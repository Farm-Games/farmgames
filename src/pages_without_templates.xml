Only the greatest Farm Games players have the pleasure of hoisting the Denley and having their names engrained on it's sides. Forged by [[Paul Denley]] at his ranch in Manitoba in 1897, the Denley Cup is made of shining silver, gold and copper, and sports elaborate decoration across it's surface. Over the past 100+ years, the Denley has grown to preposterous sizes, currently standing at 24 feet tall, 7 feet wide, and weighing 452lbs. Within the center of the Denley Cup, is the mummified corpse of Paul Denley. His shriveled finger is affixed to the bowl atop the trophy.

The Denley Cup is stored in the Denley Vaults in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It is watched over by armed guards ad all time

Traditionally, when a team wins the Denley Cup at the end of a grueling Farm Games Campaign, a special stew called the Denley Stew is poured into the bowl atop the trophy, and each teammate feasts upon Denley Stew out of the cup. This is an age old tradition that every championship team is required to do.

The Denley Cup is awarded to the champion of the Denley Tournament. Denley Cup Champions must win 16 games throughout four separate best of seven series' between the top eight Farm Games teams in their respective conference.

      <text bytes="1855" sha1="dmn7z3pv10xdd9n0grsm2tthxsltwjg" xml:space="preserve">'''Paul Denley''' is the founding father and first Lord of the Farm Games. Denley created the Farm Games alongside his brother, [[Henry Denley]], and business associate [[Sneeze Chenlin]]. These three are regarded as the Founding Fathers of Farm Games.

Denley was born in Michipicoten, Ontario on August 9, 1852. He spent most of his life working on the railroads, and for a period in the 1880's he was an oil prospector in the United States alongside his brother Henry. It was during his travels in the States that he first dreamed of creating the Farm Games. In 1894, he and Henry set out to gather six mighty clubs and build the greatest hockey association the world would ever know. In 1896, the Denley brothers met Wisconsin native Sneeze Chenlin, who committed himself to their cause. 
[[File:Paul denley.jpg|thumb|Paul Denley sitting in his favourite chair.]]
The first two hockey clubs to become official Farm Games teams were the [[Calgary Jailbirds]], led by [[Bob Bruggins]], and the [[St. John's Mariners]], led by [[D'Arcy McGibbons]]. By 1896, these two clubs were joined by three others; the [[Albany Rattlers]], [[Halifax Walrus]], and [[Newmarket Roadrunners]]. The final team was a contentious bout; the decision was between the west coast Canadian city of Victoria, or the city of Portland, Oregon in America. Eventually, thanks to the urging of Sneeze Chenlin, the [[Portland Patriots]] were born. Hence, the [[Original Six]] Farm Games teams had been assembled, and by 1897, the first official Farm Games campaign began.

Denley passed away in 1930 at the age of 78 from autistic enterocolitis. He was immortalized when his left hand ring finger was removed and forged into the top of the [[Denley Cup]], and his corpse placed at the center of the trophy forevermore. His descendants continue to rule over the Farm Games to this day.</text>

Brown was an avid stewhead, perhaps the biggest in league history. He had a close relationship with Chef Sneeze, his favourite stew cooker.]]
'''Brown Simpson''' is a legendary right winger and Farm Games Hall of Fame inductee. He is widely regarded as the greatest Farm Games player of all time. Simpson held the all time points record in the league until 1999, when he was surpassed by [[Dominic Desjardins]]. His career spanned over 20 years, from 1944 until 1967, making him one of the longest playing Farm Games forwards of all time. 

Brown was born in New Orleans in 1926. His first word was "hockey". 

He was a staple of the [[Golden Age]] of the Farm Games, and was largely responsible for leading the [[Newmarket Roadrunners]] to five separate [[Denley Cup]] victories between 1947 and 1958. Simpson played for the Newmarket Roadrunners and the [[Albany Rattlers]] during his time in the league, becoming captain of both teams during his tenure there. He sported #40 through his entire career, and the number has become synonymous with his name throughout the Farm Games.

Brown is also known to be the first player to engage in the [[Denley Fast]], a tradition in which a player fasts for the entirety of the playoffs, until they are either eliminated or win the Denley. If they win, they feast for the first time in weeks upon the [[Denley Stew]], which revitalizes them and fills them with pride and gas. Several other players have engaged in the Denley Fast since the days of Brown, and it is seen as a showing of complete commitment to the Farm Games and to the Denley.</text>

The Calgary Jailbirds are, according to experts, the best team in the Farm Games. Founded in 1896, the team is best known for winning the [[Denley Cup]] every year - as well as numerous civil rights violations in the 1960s.

== '''Known Civil Rights Disputes''' ==

=== 1941: Calgary Jailbirds v. Portland Patriots ===
Then-Captain of the Calgary Jailbirds [[Cornegie Sniff]] was banned from professional Farm Games hockey after hopping across the dividing glass to attack a group of small, Japanese children. The incident sent shockwaves across the hockey community, and the league moved promptly to ban the Japanese from attending hockey games, a policy that would only be reversed in 1996.

=== 1943: Expulsion to German-Italian League ===
The Jailbirds were excommunicated for 2 and a half years when then-owner [[Biff Horn]] admitted to striking similarities between the teams famous ruff and tuff culture and the policies of the [[Third Reich]]. The team quietly moved to the small, derelict town of [[Shudendorf]] in east Germany and played professionally in Nazi-occupied countries across Europe. The Calgary Jailbirds current General Manager, [[Todd Loxton]], has gone on record regarding this incident, describing it as a "big whoopsie" in the teams otherwise wholesome, multi-faceted history.

=== 1945: Return to Farm Games and Portland Riots ===
Upon the Jailbirds return to the Farm Games at the end of [[World War II]], the city of Portland was in an uproar, as the Jailbirds would sweep the Patriots in every matchup across their season. The Patriots demanded the permanent expulsion of the "most depraved major sports team in history". Luckily owner Biff Horn was able to file a discrimination charge against the [[Portland Patriots]] for their unequal treatment of Jailbirds players, nullifying the proposed expulsion and solidifying the Jailbirds as a permanent member of the Farm Games.

=== 1946: Calgary Jailbirds v. Farm Games ===
After Jailbirds fans began arriving to  games both home and away dressed as klansmen, the Farm Games took a legal stand against the team, demanding owner Biff Horn denounce any affiliation with the [[Ku Klux Klan]] or risk expulsion. Horn, begrudged, publicly denounced the Klan while sneakily crossing his fingers behind his back and giggling (''source - [[The Denley Tapes]], 2004'').

=== 1948: Calgary Jailbirds v. B. Simpson ===
An infamous example of Brown's struggle against racism and bigotry in the Farm Games. The Jailbirds repeatedly antagonized him, until the league eventually stepped in and told the Jailbirds to knock it off.

=== 1963: Calgary Jailbirds v. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ===
All record of the Jailbirds involvement in the plotting and eventual assassination of [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr]]. has been erased by the Farm Games.
[[File:Screen Shot 2023-01-03 at 12.59.46 AM.png|thumb]]

=== 1964: Calgary Jailbirds v. Baltimore Butchers ===
The [[Baltimore Butchers]], formerly the [[Miami Bikini Babes]], famously raised hell in the [[Vype Birdcage]] when in 1964 they hit the ice wearing their fashion-landmark brown alternates. Jailbirds fans reacted with manic screaming and convulsions similiar to famous Farm Games announcer [[Doug Walker]]. To protect the Calgary public, the Bikini Babes were banned from wearing the brown alternates in the city ever again.

=== 1967: Calgary Jailbirds Swimsuit Issue ===
The Jailbirds were under fire again when in 1967, a hotly anticipated swimsuit issue of the team featured pictures of the players assaulting beachgoers of colour. Luckily new-owner and publicity whiz [[Hard Gunderson]] was able to change public opinion by drafting only African-American prospects for years, creating the sports first all-minority team roster and traumatizing them irreversibly, resulting in numerous Denley cups.

=== 1968: Calgary Jailbirds v. TIME Magazine ===
When [[Time Magazine]] named the Calgary Jailbirds the person of the year in 1968, their cover featured numerous images of the team in racially aggressive situations, resulting in a lawsuit against the magazine for defamation. Thanks to boy genius Hard Gunderson's legal intellect, the team was able to alter the cover to a picture of their favourite insanity wolf meme.

=== 2020: Bill Peters ===
Upon hiring minor-league coach [[Bill Peters]], who famously auditioned for the Farm Games by saying the N word, many veteran Jailbirds fans are suspecting the team is making a racist comeback. Fans are divided on the implications of his presence behind the bench, but are regardless anticipating a future of good, clean Jailbirds hockey.</text>

'''Hank Chinaski''' is a Farm Games Hall of Fame centreman that played from 1974 until 1993. He currently holds the record for most assists in Farm Games history, at 1,016. He is considered to be one of the greatest Farm Games players of all time, and is well regarded as the power forward of his generation. He played for the [[Newmarket Roadrunners]], [[St. John's Mariners]], [[Cleveland Red Roosters]] and [[Halifax Walrus]].

Chinaski has won the [[Denley Cup]] four times, and has played in the Denley Cup Finals seven times. The Red Roosters of the 1980's that he captained are often cited as the greatest Farm Games team of all time, sporting seven Hall of Fame players besides himself ([[Patrick Jarvis]], [[Dean Resler]], [[Dominic Desjardins]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[Doodas Chenlin]], [[Durney Konpecki]] and [[Jonce Cleaver]]).

He currently serves as the Head Coach of the Cleveland Red Roosters. His two sons, [[Ivan Chinaski]] and [[Leo Chinaski]], are currently players. Both have won a Denley Cup, and have feasted upon the [[stew]]. He is the half-brother of [[Lamont Boisenfeu]], uncle to [[Patrice Boisenfeu]] and [[Martin Boisenfeu]], and great uncle to [[Richard Boisenfeu]]. 

Chinaski is widely known for being a virulent alcoholic, and is addicted to pain killers.

== Biography ==

=== Early Life ===
Born in 1956 to Donna and Peter Chinaski in Mississauga, Ontario, Hank Chinaski was the youngest of three children. His two older sisters, Roberta and Bonnie, five and six years his elder respectively, treated him with disdain and would pour water on his head while he was sleeping and kick his shins and on a few occasions set him ablaze. His father Peter was a miserable cretin with anger and piss issues, and would smoke large cigarettes and drink exotic liquors with things like baby eels and leeches in them, sometimes with algae. His mother was a bitch. Young Hank would escape the tumult of his home by retreating to the ice fields, where he would play hockey with woodland creatures all the live long day. He later joined a pissy league team, some bullshit Willowdale group, where he grew the strongest of all the shit kids. Throughout the 60's he idolized Farm Games players like [[Brown Simpson]], [[Bobby Chenlin]] and [[Carmine Falcone]], and strove to be hard and sigma just like them. 

=== Career ===
In 1973, at age 17, Chinaski attended a [[Farm Games Reaping|Reaping]] in Etobicoke, Ontario, where he was reaped and brought to [[Farm Games HQ]] in order to be assesed for the draft. He was entered into the 1974 Farm Games Draft, and was selected 4th overall by the [[Newmarket Roadrunners]]. He started play that season, and scored 6 goals and 12 assists for 18 points in 44 games. He spent his time in and out of the lineup during the 1974 campaign, and due to an early end because of missing the playoffs, he did not get a chance to show himself in the most horny state. Early in the 1975 campaign, Chinaski established himself as a decent grip and grope type center, scoring himself a steady spot on the Roadrunners 3rd line. Newmarket managed to make the playoffs that year, but was defeated in the second round by the reigning [[Denley Cup]] champion [[St. John's Mariners]] in six games. 

As the 1976 campaign began, Chinaski got off to a slow start, with only 2 goals and 4 assists in 34 games, and a -8 while on the ice. General Manager [[Splunge Dastard]], desperate to make sure his team could go on a deep run this campaign, traded Chinaski along with defenseman [[Stool Colber]] to the Mariners for winger [[Zilos Mascerrati]] and centreman [[Pink Rash]] midway through the campaign. Upon arriving in St. John's, Chinaski began picking up the pace and managed to score 10 goals and 28 points in the remaining 42 games. The Mariners made a run for the Denley Cup later that year, making it to the finals where they were defeated by the [[Portland Patriots]] in six games. Chinaski scored 3 goals and had 6 assists for 9 points in the playoffs that year, including the series winning overtime goal in game seven of the second round series against the [[Hamilton Hounds]].

Over the next two seasons in St. John's, Chinaski would begin to play a much more rapacious style, focusing more on the "hockey" side of the Farm Games trifecta. He gained several muscles during this time and began turning guys into sacks of mush at center ice with gargantuan cum-filled hits, and blistering their skulls with ferocious fists and teeth. During this time he was labeled as a bastard type player by much of the Farm Games media, and was considered not much more than a boneheaded penile retard who got lucky. Many sung his praises however, as he played his role well and still produced offensively. Coach [[Booker Mansfield]] said in 1978, that Chinaski "brought the money juice" and was a "good milky throbbing cock" for the team. In 1977, the Mariners returned to the finals for the second year in a row, this time facing their eternal rivals in the [[Calgary Jailbirds]]. It was here that Chinaski rekindled his rivalry with his older half-brother and Farm Games veteran [[Lamont Boisenfeu]], as the two would fight four times throughout the seven game series. Chinaski scored 4 goals and 8 assists for 12 points in that post-season, and would follow up in the 1978 playoffs with 6 goals and 16 points in 18 post-season games. The 1979 campaign saw a slight downturn in Chinaski's point totals, dropping from 48 points the previous year to 23 points in 1979. While the Mariners made it to the finals once again, and Chinaski scored 5 goals and 6 assists for 11 points, the group fell short in seven games against the [[Houston Giants]].

During the 1979 off-season, Mariners General Manager [[Coates Stanley]] made a surprising yet bold move, trading Chinaski to the [[Cleveland Red Roosters]] in exchange for defenseman [[Bronk Carlisle]], forward [[Jud Lobntahl]] and young up-and-cummer [[Gusto Simian]]. At the time, the trade was seen as a steal for the Mariners as Carlisle was a highly touted defenseman (a position the Mariners had trouble with ever since the departure of [[Slip Barnyard]]), and Gusto Simian was one of the most promising young Farm forwards in the league and would become the teams highest scorer in the early 80's. However, none of these three players traded for Chinaski would do for St. John's what Hank did for Cleveland.

In Cleveland, Chinaski was paired with wingers [[Richard Mansfield]] and [[Elbows LaFontaine]] on the 1st line. The line had unprecedented success, and both Chinaski and Mansfield would go on to have career seasons in 1980, with Chinaski scoring 27 goals and netting 67 points while Mansfield scored 38 goals and 61 points. The Roosters made the playoffs, but both Mansfield and Chinaski failed to produce, only scoring 5 points between the two of them as the team fell in a five game loss to the [[Albany Rattlers]] during the first round. The Chinaski-Fontaine-Mansfield Line remained for the 1981 campaign, but was largely overshadowed by the growing success of the 2nd line, comprised of [[Doodas Chenlin]], [[Patrick Jarvis]] and [[Durney Konpecki]], when Doodas Chenlin scored 45 goals and 38 assists for 83 points. Despite a great campaign, the Roosters fell in the first round again, this time at the hands of the Newmarket Roadrunners in six games. During the off-season, Chinaski was officially named the captain of the Red Roosters.

The following season, after the team acquired [[Dean Resler]] thanks to collusion within the [[Junior Farm Games]], LaFontaine was moved down to the third line and replaced with Resler. The Resler-Chinaski-Mansfield line combined for 150 points that campaign, with Chinaski scoring 75 of those points. The Roosters went into the post-season with the best top two lines in the Farm Games, and were heavily favoured to win the J. Valeska Conference. The team came face to face with the very same Newmarket Roadrunners who defeated them the year before, and after a grueling seven game series, Chinaski scored the game winning goal of overtime and sent the Roosters into the second round for the first time since Chinaski's tenure began. In the conference semi-finals, the Roosters were faced with their blue rivals, the [[Halifax Walrus]]. After going down in the series 3-1, Chinaski took the team on his back, mercilessly finger-blasting the Walrus net, scoring two goals en route to a 3rd period comeback in game 5. Durney Konpecki would score the game tying goal to send the game to overtime, with Chinaski and Resler combining for the OT game winner. The Roosters went on to dominate in game six, winning the game 5-2, with Chinaski scoring 2 points, including on the game winning goal scored by Richard Mansfield. This event was considered the catalyst for the [[1982 Cleveland Crime Wave]]. The series would return to Cleveland for game seven, where the Roosters would lead 4-2 heading into the 3rd period. After blowing the lead halfway through the period, [[Menace Lamsardchuk]] scored with 2 minutes left in regulation, giving the Walrus a 5-4 lead. The Roosters were unable to tie it, losing game seven and the series. That night and for the following weeks, Cleveland was ravaged by riots and attacks, in what would be known as the most devastating portion of the 1982 Cleveland Crime Wave that would last all the way until the following year. Many members of the Roosters participated in these riots themselves, and got in bare knuckle brawls with several fans. Chinaski was among these, and was going to be charged with felony property damage for lighting a clothing store on fire, but got off on all charges because of being Farm Games, as did the other players who participated. Chinaski defended his own as well as his fellow players' actions, stating that they "have a right to participate in riots too".</text>

The '''St. John's Mariners''' are an Original Six Teams in the Farm Games. They were a part of the first two teams brought into the Farm Games, alongside eternal rivals the [[Calgary Jailbirds]]. The team was initially formed by [[D'Arcy McGibbons]] in 1896. They are widely considered to be the greatest Farm Games organization of all time by most Farm Games Professors. The St. John's Mariners are the heart and soul of the Farm Games institution, and an integral part of Canadian history.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The St. John's Mariners are my favourite team" - Paul Denley&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Mariners are the most popular team in the league, alongside the Calgary Jailbirds and [[Halifax Walrus]]. Everybody loves them, except for Jailbirds fans, who are often seen as the "devils" of the Farm Games due to their dastardly deeds (hate crimes). The Mariners have also won the most [[Denley Cup|Denley Cups]] in league history, so they are definitively the greatest team of all time. Their blue and green colours are synonymous with the passion, integrity and good Christian values of the Farm Games association. The team was well known for supporting the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960's, gay marriage in Canada, and sending millions of dollars to the State of Israel since 1996, when [[Binge Dobsby]] served as the team president.

They are currently coached by [[Bundy Bill]], and former player [[Rick Daines]] serves as the General Manager. Top defenceman [[Sean Thompson]] captains the team. The organization is currently owned by "Busy" [[Bob Cobert]], with [[Sailor Jack]] as the team president. The Mariners were well known in the 70's for their lavish presentation, in large part due to their extravagant president [[Jeff Speed]].

The team was presented as the heroes of the film [[Running the Denley]].

&lt;br /&gt;

=== The Bucksy Billiards Era: 1980-1985 ===
After the death of Jonfrey Halliday, Bucksy Billiards came into sole ownership of the Mariners organization. Billiards and Jeff Speed didn't get along almost immediately, with Billiards having referred to Speed as "nothing more than a rogue beatnik, and a total faggot at that". Speed said of Bucksy in 1992:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Billiards] is a real crap-tarded shoe salesman of an owner. A disgrace to the Farm Games and the name of the Denley. Back in 1980, when he took my team from me, my glory, my horny, my love, I was convinced he was the anti-christ... one night, I awoke in my bedroom and took my gun from my nightstand, and I thought for just a moment that maybe I could go kill the bastard... kill the bastard and get my team back... somedays I wish I did, I'll tell you that much. God help us. God save us if a man like Bucksy Billiards can exist. God save us."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Speed was dismissed from his duties as team president before the beginning of the 1980 campaign, and Billiards took over this role himself. Billiards was no fan of hockey, calling it a "sport for dogs", although he admitted he enjoyed watching the underclassmen brawl for scraps on the ice. Billiards was well known for flicking his cigar butts at players after calling them into his office. He would also employ strange, draconian, almost low-level manager type tactics on his players, accusing them of "stealing from registers" and "not writing down their hours", putting up passive aggressive notes in the locker room and on fridges.

At the end of the 1980 season, after the Mariners failed to make it passed the first round of the playoffs, Billiards supposedly threw a tantrum at a meeting and was red in the face and crying, complaining about the lack of a Denley Cup, whining that he wanted his Denley NOW. Billiards forced General Manager Coates Stanley to fire head coach Booker Mansfield, who was replaced with [[Jackie Conehead]] for the 1981 campaign. Stanley attempted to keep the team afloat for the season, but the micromanaging of Billiards resulted in poor trades and a lack of synergy between the management, especially since Jackie Conehead operated on a completely different system than Stanley and was illiterate. By the end of the 1981 campaign, after the Mariners missed the playoffs and incurred the wrath of Bucksy, Coates Stanley quit as general manager and set out west.

Billiards hired his friend and a manager at one of his casino's, "Black Eye" [[Tony Preston]], to take over as the general manager. Tony ran things cheaply, but failed to secure playoff spots and had similar troubles with trading due to his inexperience and Billiards' micromanaging.  This eventually got him and Jackie Conehead fired in 1983, replaced by [[F. Lloyd Mantible]], a no-nonsense GM with strict rules, and [[Julios Montenegro Del Paulo]], a pallid young coach fresh out of a Farm Games Compound in Newfoundland. It was during this time that Billiards attempted to use the arena as a swimming pool during the day, planning to turn it back into an ice rink every night before the game. This was also when he disallowed poor people from attending games, claiming they stunk up the place.

Mantible ran a tight ship for the next few seasons, but was eventually ousted by a player mutiny, causing him to be replaced by long-time Recruiter [[Jean Jose Mantilo]] in 1985. The Labrador Colosseum was in dire need of repairs, but Bucksy refused to do them because construction was all bullshit anyway. Apparently, federal agents came and inspected the building and told Bucksy he had to repair the building or else he would go to jail or be fined or whatever, but Bucksy pulled out his gun and scared the guys away.

At the end of the 1985 campaign, after not making the playoffs again, Bucksy got so upset that he went into cardiac arrest. This lead to him deciding that hockey was too stressful, so he resigned as president and decided to return to just being the owner. He hired [[Binge Dobsby]], a hockey man from Windsor, Newfoundland who had long wished to be a part of the Mariners organization, but was blocked by Billiards because he thought Dobsby "wasn't cut out for it quite like [Billiards] was", as the new team president. Bucksy then flew away on his helicopter, and disappeared from the public eye for several years.

Formed in 1897 by businessman [[Lupin Fieldnever]], the Albany Rattlers are a staple of the Farm Games association and are considered by many to be "America's Team". The team's mascot, [[Rapist the Snake]], is known across the world and is one of the most beloved and feared mascots in sports. The team has had many Hall of Fame players, such as [[Brown Simpson]], [[Abernathy Chenlin]], [[Ted America]], [[Richard Kerny]], [[Harvey Bullock]] and [[Leonard Marsh]], among others.

The Rattlers were an object of controversy in 2020 when it was discovered they were owned by American financier and prolific sex trafficker [[Jeffery Epstein]], thus prompting an investigation into the organization. The investigation found vast evidence of collusion on part of team president [[Roberto Mbembe]], and he was arrested before the teams ownership was revoked from the Epstein estate. Ownership of the team is currently up for auction, with the Walt Disney Company and an anonymous private investor looking heavily into purchasing the team.

The team's current president is [[Doctor Snake]], who served as General Manager until Mbembe's arrest. Snake hired hockey wiz [[Trevor Irwin]] to take over as General Manager, and retained Hall of Fame player [[Jocko Fox]] as Head Coach. [[Brick Bronson]] is the current captain of the team.

He is a Hall of Fame inductee, despite having never won a [[Denley Cup]]. Fox was a well known scrapper throughout the league, racking up 213 penalty minutes during his career. While he had a reputation as a tough sigma male, he was also a talented goal scorer, winning the [[Pennyworth Memorial Trophy]] twice as well as the [[Duckworth Goblet]] in 1995. He captained the [[Halifax Walrus]] from 1997 until his departure from the team in 2004. Fox played alongside other Hall of Fame players such as [[Mark Chenlin]], [[Dean Resler]], [[Walter MacKenzie]] and [[Walter Barrett]]. His rivalry with fellow player [[Donal MacDuff]] is fondly remembered throughout the league, particularly in St. John's and Calgary as the two played on opposing sides of the heated rivalry and were both considered tough sigma males. He played for the [[Calgary Jailbirds]], Halifax Walrus and [[Hamilton Hounds]] from 1989 until 2007.

He is currently the head coach of the [[Albany Rattlers]].

In 2013, Fox was charged with a DUI and vehicular manslaughter after killing a family of four in Odessa, Texas with his SUV. His legal fee's were paid for by [[Roberto Mbembe]], and he was brought on as coach for the Albany Rattlers not long after.

Jocko was also the spokesperson for a testosterone supplement in the early 2010's, and continues to plug the supplements during press conferences. Supposedly, players on the Rattlers are made to take the supplements as a way to increase sigma and/or alpha behavior on ice. He is also the Co-chairman of the National Jelqing Committee of Canada.

Widely regarded as one of the most legendary franchises in the Farm Games, the team was inducted into the league in 1897, founded by seaman [[Rufus Booder]]. The Walrus have won several [[Denley Cup|Denley Cups]] throughout the years, but have also suffered long droughts in between cups ever since the end of the [[Golden Age]].

The Walrus were purchased from the Booder family by seafood chain [[Red Lobster]] in 2008, and a man only known as [[Red Lobster Tim]] currently sits as the team president. [[Grant Bundy]] acts as General Manager, with Hall of Fame player [[Donal MacDuff]] as head coach. [[Leo Chinaski]] is the current captain of the team.

Halifax are staunch rivals of the [[St. John's Mariners]], their east coast enemies, who have consistently shown them up in modern Farm Games history. They also have a harsh rivalry with the [[Albany Rattlers]], an animosity that was fostered during the Golden Age when the teams met several times in the Denley Tournament. Other rivals include the [[Calgary Jailbirds]], a rivalry that recently hit fever pitch after their meeting in the Denley Cup Finals last year, where the Walrus dethroned the defending champion Jailbirds, and the [[Cleveland Red Roosters]], a rivalry based on the fact the Walrus sport blue and white while the Roosters sport red and white.

Formed in 1897 by numbers man [[Antony Schmith]], the Roadrunners are an integral part of Farm Games history. They have the longest [[Denley Cup]] drought in the league, having won their last championship in 1967. The team has had many star players on their roster throughout history, most notably [[Brown Simpson]], the greatest Farm Games player of all time. 

During the [[Golden Age]], the Roadrunners were one of the most highly respected teams, winning six Denley Cups between 1948 and 1967. They have a spirited rivalry with fellow Ontario franchise, the [[Hamilton Hounds]]. 

In the modern age, while the Roadrunners have not been home to many Hall of Fame players, they host some of the most locally beloved stars in the Farm Games. Hall of Fame player [[Durg Kennelby]] is seen as one of the best captains the city had ever seen, and is cemented there as a Roadrunners legend. More Newmarket specific legends include [[Jake Gant]], [[Guri Manchelsuk]], [[Alec McLellan]], [[Anthony DiPesci]] and [[Alex Polakanuski]]. 

The team is owned by Irish-American entrepreneur [[Gimble Gufflin]], with suspected felon [[Joey Pasta]] as acting team president. [[Dave Justice]] replaced [[Lou Kerny]] as General Manager after the 2022 campaign, and [[Leddy Perence]] was made Head Coach. [[Ryan Daines]] has been captain of the team since 2019, after star forward [[Johnny Ween]] was stripped of the role.

Formed in 1897 by hockey enthusiast and hardcore racist [[Hamper Morgansen]], the Patriots were the final Original Six team added to the association. They have a deep connection to founding father [[Sneeze Chenlin]], who vouched for Morgansen and persuaded the Denley Brothers to give Portland the franchise over Victoria. The Patriots are a storied franchise, winning several [[Denley Cup|Denley Cups]] during the [[Golden Age]] and being oft cited as the team of the 1970's. 

The Patriots have an intense rivalry with fellow Original Six team, the [[Calgary Jailbirds]], a rivalry that has been dubbed "The Battle of the Birds" due to both teams sporting birds as their logo. The Patriots organization has referred to the Jailbirds as "filthy monkeys" on several occasions, dubbing them a "savage, disgraceful piece of Farm Games history that should be forgotten". The Patriots are well known for several legendary players, such as the all time most goals record holder [[Ted America]], generational playmaker [[Richard Mansfield]], Golden Age star [[Bobby Chenlin]], classic player [[Charlie Fun]], and masterful power forward [[Flame Crennelchovik]]. 
[[File:Hamper Morgansen.jpg|thumb|Hamper Morgansen, pictured in 1895. Morgansen was well known for his vigilantism before coming to own the Patriots.]]
The team is currently owned by the descendent of Hamper Morgansen, [[Reiter Morgansen]], with Golden Age hockey master [[Stank Armstrong]] as their team president. [[Brad Tichbourne]] is the acting General Manager, with all time points leader [[Dominic Desjardins]] as head coach. Centreman [[Conor Rea]] captains the team.

'''Evan "Kev" Burgess''' is a professional ice hockey defenseman for the [[St. John's Mariners]] in the Farm Games. He is known around the league for being a hacker and gizmo wiz, being a master of trinkets and a master of puppets. Alongside [[Sean Thompson]], Burgess is one half of the best defensive pairing in the Farm Games. He has won one [[Denley Cup]] as a member of the St. John's Mariners.

He is heralded as one of the greatest defensive defensemen in the Farm Games.

Kev was voted hottest Farm Games player two years in a row. In 2020, he was forced to have his foreskin removed by his wife, an event that greatly impacted his Farm Games career as his lack of foreskin affected his aerodynamics. Despite this, Kev has returned to full form and continues to play at the top level in the Farm Games. Kev is an outspoken ally of [[the gays]], and a staunch pro-circ lifestyler. He is well known in dubstep and 8-bit remix circles as "The Punisher".

He has been accused of being Jewish on multiple occasions, but refuses to speak on the legitimacy of these claims.

The Farm Games has a long history of the gays, dating back to the Golden Age when Bibi Hokonu appeared in the league and created the Miami Foreskin, a team that many have deemed "gay". Some have speculated that the Calgary Jailbirds is a team made up entirely of gay, but this is disputed by the amount of sigma males who dominate the franchise.

Speculation of gay activity within the St. Johns Mariners association have also been confirmed as of March 2nd, 2021, when 3 team members were caught playing grab-ass in the locker room. No comment has been made by the team, but fan outrage is expectedly high.

&lt;br /&gt;

=== Players and Personnel Confirmed to Be On "Gay" Or Suspected To Be As Such ===
[[Jon Loeppky]]- suspected to be doing gay in secret; cowardly


[[Jamie Thompson]]- confirmed gayhead


[[Kev Burgess]]- queercoded; due to alpha/sigma behaviour however probably ungay.


[[Talyn Birch]]- confirmed gay and queercoded


[[Sterling Mackenzie]]- some say gay; claims he really wants it up the ass (is this gay?)


[[Lorenzo Saccomani]]- queercoded; gay


[[Tristen Killeen]]- claims to "love" people in his life; gay and queercoded


[[Dalton Welsh]]- always talks about how straight penis is; probably gay related although due to hockey skill gets women &lt;small&gt;''(citation needed)''&lt;/small&gt;


[[Brick Bronson]]- caught in "gay" parts of town; watched romance movies; loves his wife


[[James Ballsack]] &amp; [[Zach Sim]]- considered gay as a pair; separately possibly ungay; Ballsack is woman beater (sigma and tradcoded)

They are a storied and highly respected franchise within the league, one of the most popular in the [[Weston Chandler Conference]]. They have won four [[Denley Cup|Denley Cups]] throughout their history. Notable alumni from the Milwaukee Pistons include [[Charlie Fun]], [[Mort Carlson]], [[Glue Chenlin]], [[Doodas Chenlin]], [[Harvey Bullock]] and [[Richard Kerny]].

The Pistons have an intimate connection to Farm Games founding father [[Sneeze Chenlin]], as he originated from Wisconsin. As such, several members of the [[Chenlin Dynasty]] played in Milwaukee, including the afforementioned Glue Chenlin and his father [[Rubber Chenlin]], [[Micky Chenlin]], Doodas Chenlin, and [[Business Chenlin]]. The club is well known for it's outspoken support of the fossil fuel industry, as they hold monster truck rallies in their arena during the offseason, as well as long standing traditions of encouraging guests to have a [[Gas Party]] in the parking lot during playoffs.

[[Chef Sneeze]], the official chef of the [[Denley Stew]] and of the Farm Games at large, originated from Pistons games. He slaves away in the kitchens at the [[Milktown Arena]], cooking copious amounts of stew and chili for players and fans to consume. The tradition of stew eating in the Farm Games was started by the original Chef Sneeze in the 1940's, and is still an accepted and celebrated part of the game to this day.

The team is currently owned by actor and musician [[Jared Leto]], with [[Fish Moony]] as the team president. [[Oswald Cobblepot]] served as the General Manager until 2021, when he stepped down due to tumours. Coming out of retirement to replace him is former player and infamous GM [[Carmine Falcone]], who has not managed a team since the [[Newmarket Roadrunners]] in 2014. Former player and Hall of Fame inductee [[Paul Morel]] coaches the team. [[Dalton Welsh]] is the captain.

He currently serves as the captain of the [[Milwaukee Pistons]], his childhood favourite team. He is well known as the smallest bastard in the Farm Games, and is highly regarded for his gremlin-esque playstyle. Many throughout the league call him "The Farm Games Ghoul" or the "Goblin of Milwaukee". Dalton has scored many points, so much so that many women have sex with him because of how many points he has in the Farm Games.

Welsh is also known to eat plenty of stew provided by [[Chef Sneeze]], such as the patented [[Piston Stew]], which on many occasions has given Welsh severe gas. He is the leagues greatest "trickster" type player, a playstyle pioneered by the likes of [[Dook Bronshaw]], [[Transon Stanwerther]] and [[Leronren Spadework]]. Welsh is also well known as a good baseball player and can do slam dunks in the basketball court, despite his small stature.

He is currently the captain of the [[St. John's Mariners]]. He won the [[York Teets Award]] in 2018, following his [[Denley Cup]] victory. Thompson is well known for being honourable but tough and sigma, holding onto his principles but never allowing them to blind him. He is the model Farm Games player, unlike his rival [[Jon Loeppky]] who is a skank. He also has a brain tumour that paralyzed half of his face, earning him the "Two Face" moniker, although this tumour is largely responsible for his on-ice skill, as before the tumour developed he was mediocre at best but after the tumour took over he has become an ace defenseman and has led his team to a Denley Cup championship once already in his short career. He and [[Kev Burgess]] are the most powerful defensive pairing in the league, rivalled only by the [[Ogden Brothers]] of the Jailbirds or [[Dougie MacArthur]] and [[Mick McElhinney]] of the [[Halifax Walrus]].

Thompson has very potent Observation Haki which allows to make top notch plays on the ice. His brother, [[Jamie Thompson]], also has a high level of Observation Haki but he is, unlike Sean, a member of [[the gays]].

      <text bytes="2241" sha1="rfl2hemn8h9xnfc7n2u2ftwqvd085xk" xml:space="preserve">The '''Hamilton Hounds''' are a professional ice hockey team in the Farm Games. They are a part of the [[First Farm Games Expansion]] of 1937. The team was founded by steel manufacturing tycoon [[Stig Hudson]], who demolished a ghetto in order to build a state of the art arena, [[The Dogville Arena]]. As the second Ontarian team in the Farm Games, the Hounds found themselves as the underdogs in the natural geographical rivalry with the [[Newmarket Roadrunners]]. 

During the [[Golden Age]], the Roadrunners were a highly lauded organization, while the Hounds suffered in mediocrity for years under the ownership of Hudson, who used the team primarily as a front for more illicit activities. The team made their first [[Denley Cup]] final appearance in 1962, where they lost in five games to the [[Calgary Jailbirds]]. Despite having classic players such as [[Mark Chenlin]] and [[Paul Morel]] throughout their history, the Hounds were unable to catch the coveted Denley and feast upon the stew. 

The teams second owner, [[Durnovue St. Hattrick]], with the assistance of his team president [[Rogger Van Booth]], revitalized the Hounds in the late-70's to early-80's, creating a whole new atmosphere using psychological techniques and crystal meth to condition their players to become nigh invincible in terms of physicality, pushing the team into relevance and making them a worthy adversary of the Roadrunners.

The Hounds won their first Denley Cup in 1996, when the underdog lineup including modern day Farm Star [[Victor Trench]], Hall of Famer [[John Ozols]], playoff maestro [[Epping Konpecki]], Hounds hero [[Noel Wyndandyk]] and then-rookie [[Cleighton Diggs]] went all the way and sealed a victory against the [[Portland Patriots]] in six games. 

The team is currently owned by all around suspicious man "Big Dog" [[Johnny Cashew]], with [[Mohammed Goswami]] as sitting team president. [[Narinder Kumar]], former district manager of Goswami's business company "Intellesigns Inc.", was appointed General Manager of the team after [[Lev Gibbert]] was fired following the teams Round 1 loss to the [[Flint Foxcatchers]] in 2020. [[Jim McPherson]], of [[Meaford]], is the current head coach. [[Tristen Killeen]] captains the team.</text>

He played for the [[Victoria Serpents]], [[Lexington Racers]] and [[Miami Tropics]] from 1987 to 1995. After his playing career ended, Gibbert took up coaching, acting as head coach for the [[Houston Giants]] for three campaigns, from 2002-2004. He was later hired as a talkman for the Farm Games broadcast in 2006, where he hosted a show called "Gibs Hot Takes", wherein Gibbert would deliver takes on Farm Games as well as politics such as PC culture and porn industry.  In 2007 and 2008, Gibbert was one of the Knights of the [[Denley Roundtable]]. He also co-hosted [[The Beef Stove]] alongside [[Colonel Scraps]] from 2009-2011, and with [[Pete Larsgaard]] from mid-2011 onward. After four years of saying baseless things and spreading conjecture on The Beef Stove, Gibbert was hired by [[Mohammed Goswami]] as a Recruitment Officer for the [[Hamilton Hounds]] in 2013.
[[File:Lev gibbert.jpg|thumb|Lev Gibbert, former General Manager and head coach and current host of the "Return of the Gib" podcast.]]
After Gibbert found talent such as [[Jaxon Gleary]] and [[Mikey Boofer]], he was given the General Manager position in the Hounds organization in 2016. Gibbert spent four years building the current Hamilton Hounds roster, until he was fired by Goswami in favour of [[Narinder Kumar]] after the 2020 season. Gibbert was heavily criticized during his time as GM due to trading talent like [[Mikey Boofer]] and [[Trill Landy]], as well as the infamous [[Max Dennis]]-[[Jonah Finks]] trade that supposedly played a big role in his firing.

Gibbert is currently looking for work as a coach or GM in the Farm Games, and in the meantime has started a political podcast called "Return of the Gib" wherein he discusses topics such as MGTOW and Dondald Trump.

      <text bytes="1837" sha1="875z2uupndzj3tgokf4erionubyhvni" xml:space="preserve">'''Epping Konpecki''' is a former winger in the Farm Games. He played for the [[St. John's Mariners]], [[New Orleans Braves]], [[Hamilton Hounds]], [[Tulsa Tomahawks]] and [[Kamloops Bohemians]] from 1981 to 2003. Epping is the younger brother of [[Durney Konpecki]], cousin to [[Bronin Konpecki]] and [[Rhubergh Konpecki]], and uncle of [[Dmitri Konpecki]]. He won the [[Denley Cup]] in 1996 with the Hamilton Hounds, playing an integral role in their historic playoff run.

Epping entered the league as a hardworking grinder who could score goals close to the net, and racked up 25+ goals in three separate seasons with the St. John's Mariners during the 1980's. His numbers dropped dramatically when he was traded to the New Orleans Braves, who insisted on playing him as a power forward on the first line, where the flaws in his game became evident. He was revitalized in a more shutdown oriented playstyle during his tenure in Hamilton, where he flourished once again, especially come playoff time when he would rack up goals and assists, making his 3rd line deceptively effective offensively.

He was eventually traded to the Tulsa Tomahawks, where he suffered from several injuries and could no longer play the physical game he had become coveted for, leading to a trade to Kamloops. While in Kamloops, Konpecki suffered another injury that he never quite recovered from, hampering his skills even further, ultimately leading to his abandonment by the Bohemians and eventual retirement.
[[File:Epping konpecki.jpg|thumb|Epping Konpecki taking a picture of his head in his backyard.]]
Epping has become an intense anti-vaxxer since the end of his career, a choice that ultimately led to the death of his only son, Buncley Konpecki. Epping was then divorced by his wife and retired to California, where he lives to this day.

He played for the [[Cleveland Red Roosters]], [[Halifax Walrus]] and [[Calgary Jailbirds]] from 1982 until 1999. He is a member of the Farm Games Hall of Fame. Resler won five [[Denley Cup|Denley Cups]] in his career, four with the Roosters and one with the Walrus. He is heralded as one of the greatest playmaker's in Farm Games history, as well as the best lovemaker. It is said Dean Resler has bedded 734 women and men, and has several unclaimed bastards across the world.

Resler took up coaching for a while in the late 2000's, coaching the [[San Diego Novas]] for several campaigns until his retirement. He is currently a Farm Games reporter, reading books and catching bugs on live TV. Resler was a member of the [[Denley Roundtable]] from 2014 until 2016, before becoming a part of the three-man show [[Old Time Cummers]], alongside [[Peter O'Don Patrion]] and [[Jimmy Swallow]] in late 2016. Dean also has his show [[Dean Reads]] wherein he teaches children about bugs and Jesus. Resler has a very large pig named [[Gordon]], whom he brings to the studio frequently and serves as a set piece during the show. Gordon has become a celebrity himself, being the most famous pig in Canada. The Farm Games legend has hinted at the possibility of him taking up a General Manager position in the near future, but nothing has been confirmed.

Dean's two sons, [[Eric Resler]] and [[Luke Resler]], both play in the Farm Games today. His brother, [[Dick Resler]], is currently the team president of the [[Lexington Racers]].

      <text bytes="2668" sha1="avscm37b8dvevv8d2e1gh0pvpfrzmjy" xml:space="preserve">'''Noel Wyndandyk''' is a former professional ice hockey winger in the Farm Games. He played for the [[Flint Foxcatchers]], [[Hamilton Hounds]], [[San Diego Novas]], [[Regina Dutchman]] and [[Kansas City Bandits]] from 1988 until 2007. Thanks to his small size, Wyndandyk made for a successful speed type player, and he would skate very fast and do tricks around guys to make them look like complete fools. One player, [[Stockton Bellrose]] of the [[Milwaukee Pistons]], said of Wyndandyk in 1998: "[He] made me very dizzy and during the intermission I puked up all my game day stew from [[Chef Sneeze]], which made me very sad and cost us the game. Noel has done it before and he'll do it again. Some might say I eat too much stew before games, but I will never stop, because the stew is what makes my game so edgy."
[[File:Noel wyndandyk.jpg|thumb|Noel Wyndandyk in his younger days circa 1993.]]
Wyndandyk is considered a hero by the Hounds franchise due to his dominant play during the 1995 and 1996 campaigns, ultimately playing a massive role in the organizations first and only [[Denley Cup]] championship. He scored 32 goals and 50 assists for 82 points in 1997, a career high for Wyndandyk and the highest point total on the team that year. 

Unfortunately, Wyndandyk could never return to that same level of play on other teams. His career hit a second wind during his time on the Regina Dutchman however, as he became a big part of their playoff success in 2004 when he netted 12 points in the second round series against the defending champ [[San Francisco Mavericks]], scoring the series winning goal in the second overtime period of game seven. The team however fell short in Round 3, losing in six games to the [[Calgary Jailbirds]]. Wyndandyk's numbers went down over the next two campaigns, culminating in only 1 goal and 1 assist in the 2006 playoffs in Round 1, where the Dutchman were swept by the [[Lexington Racers]]. He spent one season in Kansas City before retiring.

After his playing career, Wyndandyk did advertising for shoes and a brand of extra thick milk called Strong Milk. In 2012, he was hired as the coach of the Flint Foxcatchers, a position he held until 2014 when he was fired. He returned to Strong Milk until the end of the 2015 campaign, when he was approached by [[Houston Giants]] team president [[Mike Lunchy]] about coming on board as a Recruiter. Wyndandyk convinced several stupid high school knuckleheads into auditioning for the Giants, where the team found players like [[Tobin Maynard]] and [[Jimmy McGee]]. In 2017, Wyndandyk was promoted to General Manager of the Giants after former GM [[Buest Standard]] retired.</text>

'''Flame Crennelchovik''' is a former professional ice hockey centerman in the Farm Games. He played for the [[Hamilton Hounds]], [[Portland Patriots]] and [[Brandon Jacks]] from 1985 until 2004. He captained both the Portland Patriots and the Brandon Jacks to [[Denley Cup]] championships, earning himself a spot in the Farm Games Hall of Fame. Crennelchovik was considered one of the best power forwards of the 90's, pairing up with winger [[Bronin Konpecki]] on the Patriots to become known as arguably the most deadly offensive pairing in the league.
[[File:Young crennelchovik.jpg|thumb|Crennelchovik seen here in his younger days circa 1991.]]
Born in 1966 in Czechoslovakia to an unknown mother and [[gravel man]] Sperm Crennelchovik, Flame grew up very poor but managed to watch the Farm Games at the local tavern he would hang around in. His father would beat him when he spoke of the Farm Games, due to him wanting Flame to become a gravel man as well. In 1976, the Crennelchovik's defected to Canada, where Flame became even more enamored with the Farm Games, growing to become a fan of the Brandon Jacks and [[St. John's Mariners]]. Sperm hated this and tried to defy Flame's hockey dreams, but even while learning about gravel business, Flame would sneak out to play hockey on the ponds and puddles. Flame was discovered by a man named [[John Hawkey]] in 1979, who mentored Flame in the ways of hockey so that he could one day become a famous Farm Games player. One day, in 1984, Flame attended a [[Farm Games Reaping]] in Selkirk, Manitoba, where he was selected by the Recruiters to come to [[Farm Games HQ]] in Northern Ontario. Here he was tested for Farm Games eligibility, and was placed in the draft pool. He was drafted by the Hamilton Hounds in 1985, and began his Farm Games dream. It is said that after being drafted, he went to see John Hawkey, who disparated into thin air after Flame told him of his ascendance to the Farm Games.

Since his retirement, Crennelchovik has become very interested in UFOlogy and ancient aliens conspiracy theories, telling several publications that he has no plans on returning to work with the Farm Games in any capacity unless it directly correlates to his studies in the field of UFO's and extraterrestrials.

It had a budget of $33 million USD.

The film follows two laze-about fans of the Farm Games, Turk Darret (Steve Zahn) and Chent Blitford (Nick Swardson), as they travel from Los Angeles to St. John's, Newfoundland in order to deliver the [[Denley Cup]] to Game 7 of the Denely Cup Finals between the [[St. John's Mariners]] and the [[Calgary Jailbirds]] after a mix up at the airport.

      <text bytes="3260" sha1="5w57waefgz830px2ah1j2pw8yw9qzoe" xml:space="preserve">A '''Farm Games Reaping''' is a classic recruitment event used by the Farm Games organization to select players to join the Farm Games. Reapings occur all across North America, Europe and in some places in Asia. Farm Games recruitment officers gather at these events to purvey the goods, selecting players that will then be sent to Farm Games HQ for evaluation. If deemed worthy, players are placed in the draft pool and can be selected in the Farm Games Draft. Players who are decided to be ineligible are either cast out and publicly shamed, barred from participating in any Farm Games events such as games, conferences, reapings or seminars, or they are given a pamphlet referring them to the [[Junior Farm Games]], where they must pay to play for a chance to maybe someday be chosen to the play in the Farm Games. 

Some Reapings have become Farm Games Conscriptions, in which everyone attending the Reaping is forced to join the Farm Games with little to no pay. This practice is not to be confused with the [[Farm Games General Conscription]], in which several citizens with no ties to Reapings were conscripted by law to come play in the Farm Games. 

This practice has become controversial in many places, and has incurred the wrath of politicians and debbie downers across the globe. The recruiters have been accused of putting the players through rigorous tests, such as making them walk on concrete with their skates and laughing as they collapse, or shining bright lights into their eyes and screaming for several minutes, or forcing the group to perform the beep test for the entirety of the reaping which often lasts 6 hours, or releasing hounds unto the players and willing them to do battle. Classic player [[Bilston Nighfurd]] said of the Reaping in which he was picked, that during the individual evaluation, the Recruiters "...shone a great spotlight upon me, in a rink otherwise shrouded in darkness. I could make out their figures drenched in shadow, but I could not see their faces. I stood for many minutes and my knees began to shake, sweat building across my brow, awaiting an order, but none came. They merely chattered amongst themselves, in hardly discernable whispers. While I could not see them, I knew they were scowling. I eventually did my laps, my body wrapped in a queer fear that I had never once felt, and a sharp silence fell across the rink. It seemed to me there were people in the stands, but they stood more like statue than man. For how many minutes or moons I did my fearful dance across the ice, I shall never know. Finally they spoke, a booming voice that told me my time was done and I was to retire down the sphincter of a tunnel, and for a moment it occurred to me that this could be the voice of [[Paul Denley|Denley]] himself, still rolling in this mortal plane, bidding me a stern farewell, like a hard-loving father. I sat frozen in the hallways, paralyzed by my experience, and it was then the man with the puzzling head appeared and told me I was selected to travel to Farm Games HQ. Despite all my years playing within this league, this event has never left me, and the darkness of these Farm Games only grows deeper as the time goes by. I may never rest, I may never retire, but God just let me forget."</text>

      <text bytes="2067" sha1="nndhioqrjqav909wm3z5wlv390fmc87" xml:space="preserve">The '''Kentucky Colonists''' are a professional ice hockey team in the Farm Games. The Colonists were a product of the 1937 Expansion alongside teams like the [[Cleveland Red Roosters]], [[Kamloops Bohemians]], [[Hamilton Hounds]] and [[Brandon Jacks]]. The team was founded by Kentucky oil baron and rifle enthusiast [[Pentucket Fetcher]], who envisioned an ultra-patriotic team that would take the mantle of "Team America" from the likes of the [[Portland Patriots]]. For several years, the Colonists reveled in failure, yet they surprisingly became the first expansion team to win a [[Denley Cup]] in 1951. This entrenched the team in Farm Games history, ultimately growing their popularity and heritage.

In the 1960's, the Colonists organization paid several thousands of dollars as funding to white supremacist groups fighting in the Civil Rights Movement. During the 60's and 70's, Colonists fandom became a safe space for white nationalists and neo-nazi's, making them the official "Racist Team" of the Farm Games. In the late 80's, the organization and the Fetcher estate was charged in international court for human rights violations. The team was made to pay $38.9 million in reparations, while the Fetcher's were stuck with $154.6 million. This bankrupted the Fetcher estate, causing them to sell the team to Kentucky Fried Chicken for $112 million. KFC reinvigorated the team, injecting millions of dollars into the hockey. This led to a spirited cup run wherein the Colonists won their third Denley Cup in 1995. The club kept their racist aesthetic however, flying confederate flags and holding Civil War reenactments during the summer in the arena. The team even wore camo once for Army Day.

The sitting president of the Kentucky Colonists is a man known only as [[Phil the Racist]], a very polite man who supposedly holds very ill-informed and maligned views about minorities and apparently women. [[Bob Dover]] serves as the General Manager, with [[Tim Freeborn]] behind the bench as Head Coach. The team is captained by [[Michael Kennedy]].

'''Guri Manchelsuk''' was a professional ice hockey centreman that played in the lord's glorious Farm Games from 1995 until 2010. He played for the [[Halifax Walrus]], [[Newmarket Roadrunners]] and [[San Francisco Mavericks]]. He is fondly remembered for his time serving as captain of the Roadrunners during the early 2000's, and is often cited as one of the greatest Roadrunners of all time, alongside hometown legends such as [[Brown Simpson]], [[Durg Kennelby]], [[Jake Gant]], [[Daniel Rissous]] and [[Davey Antednusky]].

Manchelsuk was known for his physical play, both in the locker room and on the ice. His in-your-face playstyle has been likened to the [[Wakkit-Socket Theorum]], though some claim it is less sophisticated and that Manchelsuk instead verges on being a trickster or bastard type player. Regardless of his controversial hands-on nothing held back sigma presence, Manchelsuk was among the top goal scorers on the team, racking up 44 goals in 2003 for his career record. Over his 15 year career, Manchelsuk scored 732 points. He was nominated for the [[Pennyworth Memorial Trophy]] twice, in 2003 and 2005. He lost both years, to [[Zake Coriander]] and [[Reefer Chenlin]] respectively.

After retirement, Guri started advertising esoteric European products, and later became involved in a high profile pyramid scheme called "Luxwave". In 2015, Manchelsuk was sued as a part of a lawsuit against Luxwave, although he was let off with a lighter fine than the founders and other associates of the scam. After the lawsuit, Manchelsuk mostly disappeared from the public eye, until July 2019 when he was spotted wandering around the streets of Barrie, Ontario in some sort of fugue state. He has since escaped his fugue state, and has returned to Europe where he has been supposedly attending a sabbatical. He currently pushes alternative medicine and cosmic psychology/philosophy on social media, and plans to return to the Farm Games through a position in the media in the near future, though the Farm Games and their media affiliates have declined to comment on this possibility.</text>

The expansion took place in 1937, when several businessmen and wealthy plutocrats banded together to take advantage of the working class during the Great Depression by offering low end salaries to play on their Farm Games ice hockey teams. The Farm Games expansion teams also provided great places for draft dodgers once the war started.
[[File:New team.jpg|thumb|The first players to join the Cleveland Red Roosters, plucked from the Salt Mines of Alamongordo.]]


The eight additional teams added to the league were the [[Hamilton Hounds]], [[Kentucky Colonists]], [[Saskatchewan Wizards]] (playing out of Regina and Saskatoon), [[Brandon Jacks]], [[Kamloops Bohemians]], [[Cleveland Red Roosters]], [[Virginia Electric Hedgehogs]] (playing out of Ruckersville, West Virginia) and the [[Milwaukee Pistons]].</text>

'''Douglas Walker, aka The Nostalgia Critic''' is an American writer, director, comedian, critic, internet celebrity, musician and Farm Games hockey commentator. Walker made a name for himself doing [[Angry Reviews]] on YouTube, something the president of the [[Farm Games Network]], [[Bissil Daysley]], was a huge fan of. In 2013, Daysley approached [[Channel Awesome]] and asked them to come on board the Farm Games Network team. Doug, alongside his brother [[Rob Walker]] and [[Mike Michaud]], [[Joe Vargas]] of the AngryJoeShow, [[Film Brain]] and [[Justin Carmichael]] aka JewWario, all joined the Farm Games Network in various positions.

Drafted in 2009, Andre is the latest member of the legendary Farm Games Dynasty, the [[Jazz Family]]. He is the son of Skeleton Type winger [[Templar Jazz]]. Andre has played for the [[Calgary Jailbirds]], [[Portland Patriots]], [[St. John's Mariners]] and currently plays for his hometown with the [[New Orleans Braves]].

Andre was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1991. He learned the ways of the hockey from his father Templar and uncle [[Phil Jazz]], aka the Brown Bolt aka the Yellow Flash aka the Swamp God. Andre grew up playing at the [[Jazz Rink]], a special hockey rink built by the people of New Orleans to commemorate the legendary Jazzfather, [[Skippy Jazz]]. He is one of the most popular players in the Farm Games, due in large part to his lineage, although he has more than enough skill to back it up. Andre has been described as a "cum first, ask questions later" type player, sometimes called "Creampie Forwards". Some call him the Molassin Assassin, due to his generally slow speed yet devastating maneuvers. Some have generalized him as a power forward, although Farm Games experts contest that this is too broad a category to put a player such the Molassin Assassin under. Andre is recognized as one of the top forwards in the Farm Games, and is one of the most sought after assets. Until the 2021 offseason, he had only played for Original Six Teams ice hockey teams since being drafted, which made him an "OG Sixxer", but since his trade to New Orleans, that status has been lost.&lt;br /&gt;</text>

      <text bytes="3610" sha1="bpsjfrjmzpjlssjucxh0o8hlhrclhkn" xml:space="preserve">The '''Lexington Racers''' are a Farm Games ice hockey team, inducted into the league during the [[Fifth Farm Games Expansion]] of 1981. The team was founded by equestrian and horsehead [[Millieaux Smeglenssohn]], who put them up in his personal hockey stadium he called [[Horse Time]]. It is said Smeglenssohn formed the team out of spite for the [[Fetcher Family]], who owned the [[Kentucky Colonists]] and played out of Louisville. Rumor has it, [[Coney Fetcher]]'s horse named Biscuits defeated Millieaux's prized black stallion El Negro in a horse race, and killed Millieaux's favourite pit bull fighting dog Mr. Mean by stuffing him in a pizza oven. The Racers and the Colonists have a spirited rivalry, one that started quickly upon Lexington's addition to the league, as Colonists players would do dastardly tricks such as throw hot oil on the Racers players and shoot them with BB guns from the bench, and slash their wrists with their sticks, and sucker punch them in the balls, and trip them and step on their ankles with their skates. This cultivated a rude atmosphere between the teams, and the two would be cross with each other anytime they met. Colonists fans took things to the extreme, as they are known to do, and would burn effigy's outside Racers fans homes and in some cases burned entire houses down in the name of their beloved Farm Games team. Such is the power of the Denley.

The constant bullying and pressure from games against the Colonists forced the team and organization to grow tough and sigma, so Smeglenssohn hired [[Brute Gravedigger]] as the Team President in 1988, who proceeded to bring on General Manager [[Billy Barrett]] and Head Coach [[Muscle Skreemer]] with plans to whip the team into shape. This paid off in 1992 when the Racers went all the way and won the [[Denley Cup]] for the first and only time in their history. Players like [[Templar Jazz]], [[Mario Desjardins]], [[Skinny Yoozer]], [[Hetric Duchampagne]], [[Falcone Trophy]] and [[MacKenzie Cup]] winner [[Kalipor Maneyarco]], and stud defensemen [[Benjamin Crasseaux]], [[Stooker Grace]] and a young [[Dunsany Nils]], would all make history as members of the Racers, their names etched in gold on plaques beholding their honour all over Horse Time.

The franchise was put up for auction by the Farm Games after Smeglenssohn was arrested for plotting to assassinate a young Fetcher boy in 2002, where it was ultimately bought by Popeye's Louisiana Chicken, supposedly to spite their chicken rivals KFC who own the Colonists. Since being owned by Popeye's, the Racers have gone through several president's and general managers, with the landscape of the team changing drastically quite frequently. From 2006 until 2009 however, the Racers appeared to be in the running for the Denley, but due to instability in the organization, the deal was never sealed. Popeye's tried several other presidents and models, including a Popeye's store manager, [[Pete Gorgi]], who was sent to manage and act as president for the team for the entire 2012 campaign until his store could be reopened after a sinkhole incident involving skinheads and masochists. In 2015, [[Dick Resler]] was appointed Team President, and he brought on General Manager [[Pete Larsgaard]], with a well thought-out blueprint to get the Racers back to their Denley Cup worthy stature, in a plan dubbed [[The Racers Super Plan X]]. The team has been through multiple coaches since 2015, including [[Alfredo Jones]], [[Joey DiCostis]] and [[Rob Leonard]], and currently employs [[Scott Stiglidsky]]. [[Jean Marc Desjardins]] serves as the captain.</text>

It is the most coveted award for Farm Forwards everywhere. 1994 Pennyworth winner [[Jimmy Swallow]] famously said "I love winning the Pennyworth Memorial Trophy and scoring goals. Let's go Farm Games!" when asked on his feelings regarding the Pennyworth Memorial Trophy. The trophy is named after ancient tier "bookie" type player and Hall of Fame staple [[Jon Pennyworth]]. It is said to be the second coolest looking trophy in the Farm Games, next to the [[Denley Cup]].

There are rumors that the Pennyworth Memorial Trophy is possessed by a ghost, aka haunted or gloomed. These claims remain unverified by the [[Farm Games Paranormal Investigations Unit]], although legend has it the trophy is gloomed by Pennyworth's extra dead wife; who was said to have died twice as hard if not three times harder than Jon died, and on the night of the parade no less! She was spited and vengeful, cursing the trophy with her bitchy poltergeist forevermore. Jon was noted as calling her "very rude" in his diaries from the war, claiming he wished to run away with his fellow man at arms Butch Buttfucker, a classic omega move in which two sigma/alpha or otherwise strong, leader men join hands and elope together to do guy stuff rather than deal with the incessant yammering of womyn. This is called MGTOW or Taking The Red Pill.

'''James Joseph Michael "Unchained" Thompson'''  is a professional settler colonial Canadian ice hockey centreman in the Farm Games. He comes from the diseased town of Meaford, Ontario, which is said to be the most Farm Games lethal zone in all of the Great Lakes region. Jamie is a sigma/gamma player and is a talented power forward, being described by Farm Games experts as a "doofus" type player, making faces and what not. Somewhat of a goofball, James Joseph Michael is known for wearing wool and big socks. He has gone on record saying he wishes he was a Japanese person and intends to use his Farm Games money to get Asian Facialization surgery to make himself appear as a real Japonese Man.

Jamie is known to be lawnpilled and also hates [[cancel culture]], sticking true to his roots as a "man's man" portraying sigma values.&lt;blockquote&gt;"B*llocks to the snowflake generation!!" - Jamie Thompson, 2021&lt;/blockquote&gt;He was drafted in 2018 by the [[Portland Patriots]], where he played one season before joining the [[St. John's Mariners]], playing alongside his older brother and sigma mentor [[Sean Thompson]]. James is well known friends with fellow Farm Games players like [[Talyn Birch]], [[Matthew Hawken]] (whom he generously refers to as "the smartest man in the world" or "Big Man"), [[Sterling Mackenzie]], [[Dalton Welsh]], [[Kev Burgess]], [[Jon Loeppky]] and many more. He is said to have the most friends in the Farm Games, making him a "friendly" sigma. He has gone on record stating he despises [[Tristen Killeen]], of the [[Hamilton Hounds]], due to him being his old boyfriend. James is a member of [[the gays]] and is considered the coolest and "most dripped" fag/queercoded player in the league.

In 2021, James officially endorsed his General Manager [[Rick Daines]] when he ran as a member of the PPC, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Purple Wave Incoming!! There are only two options; PPC or Communism! Enough cancel culture!! Purple Wave Purple Wave!!" - Jamie Thompson, 2021&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</text>

They joined the league in 1937 during the [[First Farm Games Expansion]]. The Jacks are a proud and classic Farm Games franchise, called the "Pride of Manitoba" by Farm Games experts. There have been statues of Jacks players erected all across Manitoba, and those who besmirch the name of the Brandon Jacks while in Manitoba are often the victim of long and violent "hunts" wherein Jacks haters are kidnapped by Jacksheads and dropped in the remote Manitoban wilderness only to be hunted with crossbows and rifles. Manitoba is also known to be a frequent host of [[Farm Games Reaping|Farm Games Reapings]], as the voter base in Manitoba refuses to vote for any politician who opposes the Reapings, unlike other nanny state provinces such as Ontario or faggy ass Quebec who have attempted to quell the thirst of the Farm Games several times in the past. Manitoba is also known to be the most dense when it comes to the number of Farm Games Compounds, where people are raised in group homes to participate in and engage with the Farm Games, many of these people becoming players, coaches, managers, recruiters and media personnel once being released from the compound.
[[File:Hand.jpg|thumb|The withered hand of a Manitoban Denley Theif/Brandon Jacks fan]]
Manitoba is highly regarded across the Farm Games due to the fact that [[Paul Denley]] once owned a ranch there, where the [[Denley Cup]] was forged. This makes Manitobans very proud, claiming that Manitoba is the rightful home of the Denley Cup. In fact, several times over the years, Manitobans have tried to break into the Farm Games Vaults in Halifax in order to steal the Denley Cup and return it to Manitoba, but each time the perpetrators were caught and their hands were struck from their wrists. 

The franchise was founded by John Player's cigarette company, who had recently arrived in Brandon and bought most of the property there making it a [[bogie town]]. The original arena that the Jacks played in was in the center of a corn and bread field, called the [[Brandon Super Stadium]], but better known colloquially as the Ciggy Butt Barn. In 1984, the Ciggy Butt Barn was nearly destroyed by bomb attacks and arson attempts by the Brandon Retribution Squad, a group of insurgents who wished to cripple the power John Player's cigarettes had in the city. As such, the Jacks needed a new place to play, so local business master, Farm Games fanatic and styrofoam magnate [[Styrofoam Jim]] donated state of the art arena, the [[Styrofoam Dome]], to the Jacks organization. 

Despite Manitoba's deep connection to Farm Lore, the Jacks did not win the Denley Cup until 2002, their only championship to this date. The Jacks have been host to many classic and legendary players, such as Hall of Famer's [[Flame Crennelchovik]], [[Bobby Chenlin]], [[Roland P. Earle]] and [[Dominic Desjardins]], and hometown legends like [[Rhubergh Konpecki]], [[Hartler Jazz]], [[Mario Falcone]] and [[Paul Desjardins]]. The current team president is long time Farm Games fan and sponsor [[Papa John]], well known as the creator of Papa John's Pizza.  Roland P. Earle served as the General Manager since 2010, but was removed at the onset of the 2020 campaign and replaced with the Head Coach at the time, [[Colin Trevor]]. Trevor hired funny man and slickster [[Rob Filton]] as the Head Coach. They are captained by [[Danny Hetoya]].</text>

'''Peter "Stinky Pete" Larsgaard''' is a General Manager and former Head Coach and Recruiter in the Farm Games. He currently serves as the General Manager of the [[Lexington Racers]]. He is supposedly the son of two Norwegian immigrants whose names are unknown, although he has stated in the past that he is half Italian as he was the product of an affair between his mother and a dark Italian man named Salvador Merucci, as well as claiming to have pure Aryan heritage dating back to the days of Norse Mythology. He has also referred to his father as the "progenitor of modern science", making allusions to the idea that his father was either Albert Einstein or Joseph Mengele. While his exact lineage is unknown and up for debate, it is known that his family immigrated to Canada in the 1960's, where Pete was at some point sent to a Farm Games Compound in a van by his parents, where he would remain until he was 24 years of age, at which point he would become a Recruiter for the [[Quebec Royals]]. 

He would continue to serve as Recruiter, attending [[Farm Games Reaping|Reapings]] and pissy league games for the [[Miami Foreskins]], the [[Cleveland Red Roosters]], and the [[Flint Foxcatchers]] until 1987, when he was hired by the [[Tulsa Tomahawks]] as their Head Coach. His career as Head Coach brought him to the [[Kentucky Colonists]] (where he won a [[Denley Cup]] in 1995), the [[San Diego Novas]] and the [[Flint Foxcatchers]] over the years, until he was promoted to the General Manager job in Flint in 2005. He remained General Manager there until 2009, when he was fired. 
[[File:Pete caught smoking.jpg|thumb|Pete caught outside his Orillia apartment smoking cigarette in 2009]]
After being ousted from Flint, Larsgaard claimed he was done with Farm Games and that he was moving himself and his "family" to Barbados. Later that year, he was discovered to be lying as he has no family save for one sickly cousin in Utah, and he had actually been living in an apartment complex in Orillia, Ontario. He returned to the Farm Games by early 2010, joining the [[San Francisco Mavericks]] as a coaching consultant. In 2011, he became a media personality alongside [[Lev Gibbert]] on the show [[The Beef Stove]]. During his time as a talking head, he spread many lies about several players, including a claim that [[Burty Brudo]] was spreading chollera around the [[Milwaukee Pistons]] dressing room in 2013. In 2015, he was hired by the Lexington Racers as General Manager after [[Dick Resler]], Pete's old gambling and lying friend, was appointed team president of organization by Popeye's.

Larsgaard is known for being a consistent and unrelenting liar, constantly lying about bizarre things like his origins, his diet, his taste in decor and art, his friends, even going so far as to denying his need to defecate, claiming he has "never shit a day in his life" and that he would rather "be butchered like an animal than take a dump". This caused much controversy when he was caught shitting his pants at a Longo's in 2011. He later claimed he has never been to Longo's and has never even heard of the place. His lying habits extend to the Farm Games however, as he has attempted to lie his way through trades on occasion, sometimes claiming he would trade other GM's players that were not on his team, and gaslighting other GM's into fighting each other on several occasions. Larsgaard is known as a Machiavellian schemer, and GM's know to be on their toes when negotiating with him due to his slippery tongue and cheap lies.

Larsgaard has supposedly been super involved in Neo-Aryan mythology and conspiracy theories, considering himself a classical Norseman, like a Viking or something of the like. He is also very angry about [[cancel culture]], and even wrote a book called "Cancel This!: How Third Wave Feminism Is Making Things Hard for Rapists", which he appeared on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show to promote.</text>

'''Tristen "Venom Trill" Killeen''' is a professional Canadian ice hockey winger in the Farm Games. He is the captain of the [[Hamilton Hounds]]. He was drafted in 2017 and advertised as the power forward of the future, being considered the rare "venom" type player. The Hounds drafted him in order to continue to build a powerful team around him, although success has been far out of reach. His playstyle is reminiscent of players like [[Stunk Fruud]], [[Bhorgie Jennsohn]], [[Dilfy Dabbert]] and [[Leddy Perence]], as he does the charge move and has slinky grimmy emaciated ghoul body to slime around players and then attack with boney protrusions. Venom Trill is prone to outbursts and autistic stimming, and many consider him [[straight retarded]], although Farm Games experts claim this is just due to a lack of oxygen to his brain.
[[File:Trill vs james.png|thumb|Trill and Jamie Thompson battling after Tristen stole James' pizza pocket, resulted in the destruction of Tristen's glasses and a rough hate fuck later that night between the two]]
Venom Trill is known to have many enemies around the league, and many consider him a villain class player due to his actions and harsh racism, not to mention his pure unadulterated hatred for womyn. He is also a big fan of eat rock, as he frequently chews on stones of various sizes, which is why his teeth are so small and sharp. He is a violent alcoholic, and attacks people on the streets, being labeled feral on multiple occasions and having to be put down with tranquilizers and/or boots to the ribs.

He is kind of [[The gays|gay]], but some believe that was simply a trick to point out the hypocrisy of the far left.

=== Enemies of Venom Trill ===

* [[Jamie Thompson]]- former boyfriend
* [[Ian the Destroyer]]- former teammate; once battled Venom Trill on the streets of Toronto; bloodied him
* [[Trill Landy]]- former teammate; stole Venom Trill's handle and also tried to rob him one time but got in trouble from his mom and had to give trill his stuff back
* [[Sterling Mackenzie]]- hates him for being gay &lt;small&gt;(citation needed)&lt;/small&gt;
* [[Jake Lisser]]- hates him for being Jewish
* [[Mikey Boofer]]- called him a slime and a sneeze
* [[Lev Gibbert]]- former GM; says Gibbert molested him; yeah right!
* [[David Long]]- former coach; called Long a cyclops looking freak; true
*[[Danny Hetoya]]- Venom Trill does not like Asian people on principle

      <text bytes="2421" sha1="9adqsmrxwfq2hfaoxay7le8kr0wcjto" xml:space="preserve">'''Matthew "Hatthew Honkin Stockman the Human Helicopter" Hawken''' is a professional Canadian ice hockey defenseman playing in the Denley's Glorious Farm Games. He is the alternate captain for the [[Portland Patriots]], the team he was drafted to in 2016. Hawk Man is a spirited quicktime event type defense man, consistently turning up the heat in the "danger zone" and keeping things spicy. Some have attempted to besmirch his name, calling him a trickster and/or bastard type player due to his constant use of the [[Wet William Tactic]], although Hawken and his teammates vehemently deny this, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Wet William Tactic is simply a part of playing the game. If you don't like it, get out of the Farm Games. I played through plenty of Wet Williams and spotty dodge creampies in my day, these soft players are trying to tell me they can't handle a little wet pinky fingerblasting their eardrum? Fucking [[cancel culture]] has made fools of us all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;- [[Dominic Desjardins]], coach of the Portland Patriots

Hawkins is highly respected in the field of smoking, being included in the top percentile of [[Most Smoking Farm Games Players]]. He is self-styled as a bogie connoisseur, as he smokes John Player Rich. Hatthew Honkin Stockman generally generates most of his power from prolonged periods of no movement, called Clown Time, in which Hawk gathers several joules of energy through eating sweet chilli heat doritos with nacho cheese dip and drinking pesbi. This is what allows Hawken to perform at such peak capacity on the ice. He is known to fart plenty during games, due to the cheesy chips and dip. 

Matthew has been a staunch supporter of robot judge for years, advocating for the destruction of all roads and a return to a primitive lifestyle, except with robot judge and he gets ATV's and big cool guns. He is also well known for being a Mandalay Bay truther, claiming the presence of the H-word at the event raises skepticism about shooter Stephen Paddock's allegiances. Stockman also has a complicated and full-proof plan for defending the borders of Meaford, Ontario, in the event of some economic collapse or otherwise apocalyptical circumstance such as [[Hog World]]. He claims he would make [[Sean Thompson]] the Admiral of the Navy in this plan, and would welcome him and his refugee's into the stronghold with open arms, no matter how many settlements they may have raided.</text>

'''Jake Gant''' aka The White Saviour is a Canadian professional ice hockey centerman that played in the Farm Games from 1979 to 1999. He played for the [[Victoria Serpents]], [[Halifax Walrus]] and [[Newmarket Roadrunners]]. He spent most of his career with the Newmarket Roadrunners, and served as the team's captain from 1997 until his retirement. Gant never won a [[Denley Cup]], but is highly regarded as an incredible sport man leaguewide. Gant played the difficult Dark Skeleton style, a variation on the Skeleton type forward, but was often considered an Indian Rugrat type player by critics and talking heads, due to his statuesque positioning in the offensive zone and long stick.

Born and raised in Sutton, Ontario, Jake Gant spent much of his time at the native reserves, playing hockey with the boys. They were all big fans of the Newmarket Roadrunners, and aspired to become Farm Games players someday. However, the native boys felt there was no way, due to the prejudice of the Farm Games, but Jake rallied them and told them not to be downtrodden, and that the Farm Games awards skill and talent all they need to do is train! And thusly they trained, becoming powerful farm boys, and eventually once they were all ready, they attended a [[Farm Games Reaping]] in Barrie, Ontario. Only Jake was picked to be put in the draft. This stirred a controversy, as the story of Jake and the indian kids became the talk of the town, the new heartwarming story, suddenly dashed by the persistent and expected bigotry of the Farm Games. The Farm Games made an official statement in response to these concerns, saying "we only let Jake Gant in because we are racist". This cleared everything up for the public, and it was deemed the Farm Games had a justification all along.
[[File:Dushaun.jpg|thumb|Dushaun Wullucks, superstar and fan of the Newmarket Roadrunners.]]
Gant retired at age 37, scoring 988 points in his career. He was honoured with a day of silence in Newmarket, wherein the town became a complete ghost town and no one left their house or did anything, a tradition that began when [[Brown Simpson]] left the team in 1960. The Roadrunners paid tribute to him with a video edit featuring the music of the [[Dave Matthews Band]], Gant's favourite band. During this same game, pop star [[Dushaun Wullucks]] played a set during the second intermission. Dushaun appeared on stage amongst smoke and fog and neon lights, and he stood there and everyone was going crazy like with Michael Jackson and then Dushaun bust out into his 1997 comeback hit "I'm Back", that had the crowd absolutely losing their minds. He then followed this up with a soulful and tight rendition of his jazz rock classic "Waterproof Jeans". He then closed out the show with one of the most heartfelt performances of his legendary definitive song, "Rosebush In My Garden", which brought Gant to tears. Dushaun and Gant shared a long hug after the show, and Dushaun left Gant with bizarre piece of leather with a message written in a forgotten script upon it. When Gant read it, he brought the leather to his heart and saluted.
[[File:Jake gant 47.jpg|thumb|Gant in 2009.]]
After retiring, Gant had a midlife crisis almost immediately and bought things like a cottage and two boats and two motorcycles because he wanted his wife to ride one too and they would be a motorcycle couple but she didn't want to ride a big stupid loud Harley so he bought her a Mazda instead, and for a while he wore bead and/or sharktooth necklaces, leather jackets and had his hair in a ponytail. He eventually gave this up however when his wife ''really'' stopped having sex with him, so he became a trim and proper [[Family Guy]], more of a Thanksgiving type guy than a motorcycle dad. He sold his bikes and bought a Honda. 

In 2009, he began working within the Farm Games again in a limited capacity, sometimes appearing on media and TV shows to discuss rumours and what not. Gant got in multiple screaming matches with [[Pete Larsgaard]] while appearing as the guest on [[The Beef Stove]], which gained him more popularity as a broadcaster. In 2012, Gant tried to make a gritty crime drama film called "Bad City", which featured his blatant self-insert former sports man turned detective character Jack Gordon solving crime and having lots of sex with his hot wife. The project unfortunately never made it very far, as [[Denley Studios]] nor [[Gufflin Studios]] were particularly interested in financing it, and Gant had already spent most of his money on his cottage and boats and cars and tripods for his movie. 

After this catastrophe, Gant got into politics in 2014-2015, running on a "nothing held back" platform in his hometown of Sutton. He lost. Following his stint in politics, Gant was running out of money and decided to pursue work in the Farm Games media, becoming the co-host of "[[Piss Cold Ice]]" with [[Stefan Knight]] from 2016 until 2019. Since then he has been working as a coaching consultant with [[Jonse Cleaver]] on the [[Houston Giants]].

His daughter, [[Sabrina Gant]], is a lesbian. She has been on the TV, on shows such as [[Genuine Leather]], [[The Hotstove]] and [[Pennington Rock]]. His eldest son, [[Liam Gant]], runs a business grindset Instagram page with 501k followers. His youngest son, [[Jesse Lee Gant]], currently plays in the pissy leagues on some bumfuck Georgina Rockets team.</text>

'''Durney Konpecki''' is a Polish-Canadian professional ice hockey winger in the Farm Games ice hockey league. Drafted in 1979 by the [[Cleveland Red Roosters]], Durney is one of few Farm Games players to have won with every team he played with, winning three cups with the Red Roosters between 1983-85, one with the [[Albany Rattlers]] in 1989, and one with the [[Milwaukee Pistons]] in 1999. As such, Durney is considered one of the greatest Farm Games players of all time, racking up 701 points in his 21 year long career. Durney is the 2nd cousin of [[Bronin Konpecki]], the older brother of [[Epping Konpecki]], father to [[Dmitri Konpecki]] and grandfather of [[Lemony Konpecki]]. [[Cank Dzvtednuska]] is his 1st cousin once removed on his mother's side.

Durney's parents, Lube Konpecki and Mistreselle Dzvtednuska, immigrated to Canada from Poland in 1959, a year before Durney was born, alongside Mistreselle's uncle, Stub Dzvtednuska and his two wives. They settled in Moncton, New Brunswick, where they lived for several years. Durney used to play field hockey with a bunch of lesbians, who took him in as one of their own. As such, Durney considers himself a half lesbian, and a devout TERF. He was found at a [[Farm Games Reaping]] somewhere in Quebec, and was put in the Farm Games draft for 1978 but was left unselected until 1979. Durney played a tough lesbian playstyle, playing strong and hard and ruffling men in the corners. Durney was often labeled a bastard type player due to his remarks on ice and for spitting on other players. He had a career year with the Albany Rattlers in 1988, scoring 43 goals and 60 assists for 103 points.

Durney retired in 2000, and promptly left his wife in order to return to Poland to be with a Japanese woman he claimed to be in love with. This turned out to be a ruse, and Konpecki was robbed. He remained in Poland for the next several years, marrying a miserable woman named Helmut. He eventually returned to Canada, leaving Helmut behind and declining to comment on her fate. He spent most of the 2000's advertising for an all-lesbian anti-abortion group, but parted with the organization in 2009 after a drunken brawl at a Pizza Pizza in Owen Sound. Durney then became a violent alcoholic, being known openly as such due to several public disturbances. In 2013, he started a fundraiser for children in the Congo alongside supposed "veteran of the Congo War" Brooks Painfield and entrepeneur [[Johnny McChicken-Dougal]], but the trio pocketed the funds and were targets of a large investigation. Painfield was found to be stealing valour and was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was drone striked after 6. McChicken-Dougal fled the country, supposedly he has been living in Polynesia ever since. Konpecki was in hot water but was saved by the Farm Games Network, who offered him a job as a sports analyst. Konpecki appeared as a guest on many shows such as [[The Beef Stove]], [[Sex Box]], [[Let's Talk!: Farm Games]], and [[Denley Roundtable]], as well as hosting the [[Farm Awards Ceremony]] in 2016 and 2018.</text>

      <text bytes="1082" sha1="o77ehog9cqpjy3dqh1q2dvb6yi5d5kj" xml:space="preserve">'''The Beef Stove''' is a Farm Games Network show wherein two hosts sit upon a table and discuss Farm Games rumors and events in a "good cop bad cop" type situation, currently hosted by [[Blark Darson]] and [[Gerrard Spartan]]. Hosts of the Beef Stove must be calculated with "yes, and", a high level acting technique. The show is credited for starting many rumors and bringing unwarranted harassment to players, coaches, team staff and even civilians on several occasions, making it perhaps the spiciest show on the Farm Games Network. The show premiered in 2005, hosted by talk show host and funny man [[Dunce Sperg]] and knucklehead former player [[Scott Stiglidsky]]. Since then, the show has gone through several hosts and iterations.

'''Stockton "Beefcake" Bellrose''' was a professional Canadian ice hockey winger in the Farm Games league. Stockton was undrafted and joined the league in 1982. After playing 3 seasons in the [[Junior Farm Games]] with the [[Waterloo Bunts]], he was picked up by the very new team, the [[Niagara Falls Chaps]], as a discount player. He spent a few months in the shoe bin, but ended up proving himself a decent squeezer and throbber on the ice, scoring himself a pretty regular spot on the Chaps roster. Bellrose went on to have a hard and strong career, playing until 2003, when he was 41 years old. After leaving the Chaps, Bellrose played for the [[Cleveland Red Roosters]], [[Houston Giants]], and [[Milwaukee Pistons]], winning three [[Denley Cup|Denley Cups]] along the way (twice with Cleveland, once with Milwaukee).

Farm Games experts consistently agree that Bellrose is a classic proponent of the [[Wakkit-Socket Theorum]], although he is a rare specimen in that he is one of very few Wakkit-Socket theorists to utilize the [[Wondu]] style variation (his peers include [[Desthony Welles]], [[Delanor Butane]], [[Cube Nelson]] and [[Brocci Stanwerther]]). His masterful use of the Wondu style Wakkit-Socket Theorum made him a deadly player on the ice, devilishly spewing on any and all competition. Bellrose was a meaty man, thick and spongy, which made him perfect for dry humping guys along the boards and stick-stunking into the blind spots at 450q, from wide to short angles, OR along the red line. Stockton scored 338 goals and 529 assists for 867 points over his career, with most of those goals coming from in the splinter zone, where Stockton would get greasy and greedy along the blue paint, five hole creampies and glove side miscarriages were the Bellrose special, if you treated him right that is!

Stockton is well remembered in Milwaukee, for his love of the stew, and in Cleveland for the big bear hugs he would give women on the streets. After his retirement, Stockton moved to Florida, where he lives to this day. He briefly pursued work in the Farm Games media circuit, becoming a regular commentator on shows like [[Let's Talk!: Farm Games]] and [[Spice Seat]] from 2011 until 2013, but he was dropped by the Farm Games Network after he fell asleep on air several times. He did advertising for a phone service called Phone Zap, but later sued them due to infraudment. He lost the case, and began advertising for their rival brand, QuikPhone. Bellrose is well known for being one of the dumbest Farm Games players of all time, as he is almost always drooling and has a head "...full of nothing but gizmos and doo-dad's, kid has no sense for business or things like clocks, cars, mechanical objects or sometimes doors...", according to his former coach [[Menken Semen]]. Nowadays, Bellrose hates [[cancel culture]] and liberal media, as he can often be seen going on long, painful screeds on Facebook. He is a devout libertarian and free thinker, and is currently writing a book about free market principles called "Live Free And Die". He has most recently appeared on [[Lev Gibbert]]'s podcast, where he talked about COVID-19 conspiracies and the Great Replacement Theory for 3 and a half hours.

'''Blark Darson''' is a Farm Games media personality, former Recruiter, coach and renowned magician. He was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1972 to a Jewish man from somewhere in Europe named Lebstein Darson, and an unknown mother. Lebstein loved Farm Games, and would watch it and hoot all night long, teaching Blark the ropes of Farm Games. As a boy, Blark loved the Farm Games and magic more than anything, as he would practice magic tricks like biting other kids and killing snails, and would play retard hockey with the kids in the neighborhood. He ended up pursuing a career in magic, performing tricks like pickpocketing and punching strangers, but his bit ultimately failed when he was 25 after he threw bull testicles and horse blood on a nine year old boy at his birthday party.

After his magic career went to the shitter, he decided to do the only other thing he knew; Farm Games. He was never a good player due to his stumpy legs and attitude, but he knew the Farm Games inside and out and was very sexist, so he ended up scoring himself a job as the nut cleaner for the [[Albany Rattlers]] in 1999, wherein he would clean the spunk and nut off the locker room and box suite floors at the Snake Pit once the boys were done with it. Everyone loved Blark because he loved cleaning jizz so much, he loved the smell, so everybody started calling him "Big Cum" around the place. Blark's notoriety grew in the organization due to his hard work and quick thinking, and one day after cleaning up stinky loads, he finished drawing up plays on the chalk board in the locker room that had been left there by the coaching staff, like in Good Will Hunting. The coaching staff discovered this and were like "Is this Big Cum? Did the spum boy do this?". They wanted to know the truth, so Blark was asked and he revealed he knew everything about Farm Games in a scene where he like said all the stats really fast like Mark Zuckerberg revealing himself to be a Farm Games genius. He was swiftly hired as a Recruiter for the Rattlers in 2001.

Darson served as a recruiter from 2001 until 2009, and was the most successful door-to-door recruiter, as he would get suburban parents to enroll their teenage sons into the [[Junior Farm Games]] at rates previously unseen, raking in millions of dollars for the Farm Games organization. He became one of the most important Recruiters, being known at [[Farm Games Reaping|Reapings]] as "The Hawk", as he could always spot the best prey. Players knew to always try and impress Blark at Reapings, be it through hot steamy iceplay or sexual favours such as rim job and blow job. As such, he got many rimmers and blowers, and claims to have busted a nut at least 450 times in direct relation to his work. He left the Rattlers organization in 2007, after receiving a better offer for more cold hard cashola from the [[St. John's Mariners]]. His recruiting talents scored them hard boiled studs like [[Jackson Stallion]], [[Lupin Doughry]] and [[Ivan Chinaski]].

Blark briefly coached the [[Brandon Jacks]] for 7 months in 2010, but was fired because he would constantly zone out during games and forget to coach. He was later hired by the [[Baltimore Butchers]] in 2011, and managed to keep his job until 2013. After losing the job due to his attitude, he decided to perform the greatest magic trick he has ever done, when he assaulted a prostitute in Baltimore and made the charges disappear thanks to a trick called "networking" with the right people at the Farm Games Network. He was then given a job as a Farm Games Analyst, and in 2015 he replaced [[Pete Larsgaard]] as one of the hosts of [[The Beef Stove]], alongside [[Bonbon Cherrise]] until 2018, and [[Gerrard Spartan]] currently. Currently, Darson is the longest sitting host of the show, as he has been on for six years. In his time he has become very well known and is considered one of the best hosts the show has ever had thanks to his riveting takes, liberal use of slurs and constant screeds about unconfirmed rumors regarding players and organizations. Darson has accused several players of having done gay, with a particularly harsh campaign against [[Brick Bronson]] of the [[Albany Rattlers]], whom Darson says scorned him by not inviting him to an unspecified Gala event in 2016 and instead taking his wife and teammates. Darson has coordinated harassment campaigns against several people throughout his career, has doxxed numerous fans and team staff, and has even released revenge porn of [[Jon Loeppky]] twice. He is considered a master troll.&lt;br /&gt;</text>

      <text bytes="2043" sha1="lbo4apf168bexst8l2ydkwfm8qavuak" xml:space="preserve">'''Dan Desmartins''' is a French-Canadian former professional ice hockey winger that played in the Farm Games ice hockey league. He played for the [[Albany Rattlers]], [[Houston Giants]] and [[St. John's Mariners]] from 1977 until 1997. Desmartins captained the Houston Giants for 11 seasons, from 1984 until 1995. After his retirement, he worked as a numbers man for a few years, but struggled due to his mushy brain. He was hired as the host of [[The Beef Stove]] in 2008, but people could not understand him properly because he always mumbles and has a thick stupid frog accent. He has since served as a Knight of the [[Denley Roundtable]], the host of [[The Quizmaster]], and most recently his show [[Dan Time with Dan Desmartins]].

Desmartins was a classic creampie forward, one of the first of his time, as he would cream guys along the boards and in the neutral zone and score big cums from the point. His cumshot was renowned across the league, and he became known as one of the most deadly coomers in the league. His time in Albany was filled with accolades, as he scored in the top 3 on the team in his first three seasons, nearly winning the [[Pennyworth Memorial Trophy]] in 1979. He solidified himself as one of their top 6 forwards, and grew a reputation for cumming fast and hard, using his big body to hump guys and put them in bad spots where the hyenas could take advantage while he goes and fucks the goal for the 2-1 lead, that's the Desmartins Cumshot baby!! 

After his horny early seasons, Desmartins' production saw a downturn, although he still remained a consistent cummer and an asset to the team. However, in 1982, the Rattlers missed the playoffs after an abysmal season, and pressure was up high as fans and the media wanted blood. General Manager [[Stocks Bloodman]] convinced the owner and president/vice president that the team and it's core would bounce back in 1983, and saved himself from ruin. Unfortunately, in 1983, they did not bounce back, and Bloodman was fired along with the coach he hired.

      <text bytes="3752" sha1="jesapj7rk6igu1xiiza1id0fkr36mh5" xml:space="preserve">'''Conor "Very Handsome" Rea''' is a professional Canadian ice hockey centreman in the Farm Games and captain of the [[Portland Patriots]]. He is the self-proclaimed "Smartest Man In The World". He is well known for his constant anti-semitic remarks, and playmaking ability. His extremely high IQ, which he claims to be "over 500" allows him to analyze the hockey on a level like none other, to the point many call him "Conor of the Sharingan" due to his clairvoyance. 

Drafted in 2015, Sir Rea was born and raised in [[Meaford]], Ontario aka the greatest Farm Games town of all time. He learned how to do hockey through intense analysis, like Moneyball, and thusly, despite having never learned to skate, he became a world class ice dog by age 17. In his younger days, he was a member of the [[Celestial Dragons]] alongside fellow Farm Games warriors [[Jacob Sanderson]], [[Jason Genova]], [[Sean Thompson]], [[Talyn Birch]], his evil cousin [[Colton Rea]] and known gay [[Jamie Thompson]]. He was also [[goth]]. 

Conor is the executive producer and head of field for the hit television series [[The Hotstove]] on The CW, starring [[Jason Statham]] as Conor Rea and [[George Lopez]] as Sean Thompson, among a myriad of other real life stars such as [[Trey Phillips]] (played by [[Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]]), Jacob Sanderson (played by [["Stone Cold" Steve Austin]]) and Jason Genova (played by [[Luis Guzman]]). Rea and Thompson have been embroiled in controversy for years, as they have stopped producing The Hotstove and refuse to comment on it's status.&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Mankel McMank]] (Farm Games reporter): Mr. Rea your game has been impeccable these past few nights you have been cumming and making cums left and right, what is the secret formula to your success on ice?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rea: It's because I am the smartest man in the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;McMank: Of course! What are your priorities as captain of this storied franchise, bird champions Portland Patriots?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rea: Well for one thing I really plan on sticking to the teams roots; racism. I'm in the locker room screaming at guys and giving them purple nurples, but not everything is up to me, sometimes you have to look to the higher ups. That's all I'll say.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;McMank: Great to hear, everybody loves the Patriots good, rude, and racist! Diverting from the "Hockey" side of things to the "Money" side of things, many have been wondering when the hit show The Hotstove will return to the airwaves, do you have any updates on that?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rea looks off-camera at his lawyers like in that Jeff Epstein interrogation video&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rea: What the fuck is this? Who is this fucking guy?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;McMank: The people deserve to know about Hotstove!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rea: We're done here. That's it. You're through working in this town, buddy. You're toast.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rea is distinguished member of the 1st Line on the Portland Patriots, called the Council of Doom, alongside Jason Genova and Trey Phillip. They are well renowned as one of the most deadly lines in the Farm Games, due to their chemistry thanks to "telekinesis" (a claim made by Genova, not backed up by Phillip nor Rea). Rea's kekkei genkai play style allows him to make top of the line plays and passes, paired with Phillips' nothing held back [[Void style]] and penis pressure in the netfront and Genova's [[Sniper: Phoenix Style]], the line becomes and indomitable fortress of pump and dumping in their opponents danger zones.

Rea is also the creator of [[Dinoman]], a comic book series which he also refuses to reprint or continue. He has threatened people using feral hounds when pressured about it.</text>

'''Peter O'Don Patrion''' is a former professional ice hockey forward in the Farm Games ice hockey league. He played for the [[Milwaukee Pistons]], [[Baltimore Butchers]] and [[Concord Corsairs]] from 1994 to 2011. He won the [[Pennyworth Memorial Trophy]] in 1999, the same year he won a [[Denley Cup]] with the Milwaukee Pistons. He scored 505 goals and 774 points in his career. O'Don Patrion was entered into the Farm Games Hall of Fame in 2013, two years after his retirement. 

Peter was a well-known cummer in the Farm Games, best recognized for his lewd gestures such as penis jerking and pussy fingering. A perennial jokester, Peter garnered a reputation as a jester type player, making players laugh and doing tricks such as purple nurple. His funny antics got him into trouble, when he made the funny joke about how the [[Holocaust]] "didn't go down like that" while doing an interview on the daytime television program [[Breakfast Television]] in 2009. Many called for a public apology from O'Don Patrion, but he claimed he would never apologize because that isn't apart of his principles.

Currently, O'Don Patrion is a frequent guest on [[Piss Cold Ice]], among other Farm Games programs. He also shills for gambling companies, having a large stake in [[Dirty Bets Online]], a supposed money laundering scheme conjured up by infamous conman [[Coney Liberani]] and his goons Peck Pockinson and [[Grip Total]]. He was arrested in summer of 2015 after he was caught drinking and driving with a prostitute in his range rover, $4000 worth of cocaine and crack, sixteen packs of illegally pressed Benedryl, and 14 firearms. He got off thanks to his lawyer, [[Spinster Laurent]], a well known consort of Coney Liberani.</text>

World War II was when bad men attacked Canada, and America, and France, and they were really mean. But it's true, and they also were mean to Polish people and mean to Spanish people, and the Jews too. Then America did an explosion on Jarpan and, Russia came in and saved Germany. And Russia pushed Germany back from Poland and liberated Germany from the evil Japanese people who were being mean there.

"Tear down that wall!" - Mikhael Gorbachev

And they fixed Germany. And with God as their witness, Russia saved England and Germany from World War II. And that's the story of World War II.
