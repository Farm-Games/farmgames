**The Beef Stove** is a Farm Games Network show wherein two hosts sit upon a table and discuss Farm Games rumors and events in a "good cop bad cop" type situation, currently hosted by [Blark Darson](blark_darson) and [Gerrard Spartan](#a). Hosts of the Beef Stove must be calculated with "yes, and", a high level acting technique. The show is credited for starting many rumors and bringing unwarranted harassment to players, coaches, team staff and even civilians on several occasions, making it perhaps the spiciest show on the Farm Games Network. The show premiered in 2005, hosted by talk show host and funny man [Dunce Sperg](#a) and knucklehead former player [Scott Stiglidsky](#a). Since then, the show has gone through several hosts and iterations.
