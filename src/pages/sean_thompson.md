**Sean "Two Face" Thompson** is a professional ice hockey defenseman in the Farm Games. He is currently the captain of the [St. John's Mariners](st__john_s_mariners). He won the [York Teets Award](#a) in 2018, following his [Denley Cup](denley_cup) victory. Thompson is well known for being honourable but tough and sigma, holding onto his principles but never allowing them to blind him. He is the model Farm Games player, unlike his rival [Jon Loeppky](#a) who is a skank. He also has a brain tumour that paralyzed half of his face, earning him the "Two Face" moniker, although this tumour is largely responsible for his on-ice skill, as before the tumour developed he was mediocre at best but after the tumour took over he has become an ace defenseman and has led his team to a Denley Cup championship once already in his short career. He and [Kev Burgess](kev_burgess) are the most powerful defensive pairing in the league, rivalled only by the [Ogden Brothers](#a) of the Jailbirds or [Dougie MacArthur](#a) and [Mick McElhinney](#a) of the [Halifax Walrus](halifax_walrus).

Thompson has very potent Observation Haki which allows to make top notch plays on the ice. His brother, [Jamie Thompson](jamie_thompson), also has a high level of Observation Haki but he is, unlike Sean, a member of [the gays](the_gays).
