> Jake Gant in 1997.

**Jake Gant** aka The White Saviour is a Canadian professional ice hockey centerman that played in the Farm Games from 1979 to 1999. He played for the [Victoria Serpents](#a), [Halifax Walrus](halifax_walrus) and [Newmarket Roadrunners](newmarket_roadrunners). He spent most of his career with the Newmarket Roadrunners, and served as the team's captain from 1997 until his retirement. Gant never won a [Denley Cup](denley_cup), but is highly regarded as an incredible sport man leaguewide. Gant played the difficult Dark Skeleton style, a variation on the Skeleton type forward, but was often considered an Indian Rugrat type player by critics and talking heads, due to his statuesque positioning in the offensive zone and long stick.

Born and raised in Sutton, Ontario, Jake Gant spent much of his time at the native reserves, playing hockey with the boys. They were all big fans of the Newmarket Roadrunners, and aspired to become Farm Games players someday. However, the native boys felt there was no way, due to the prejudice of the Farm Games, but Jake rallied them and told them not to be downtrodden, and that the Farm Games awards skill and talent all they need to do is train! And thusly they trained, becoming powerful farm boys, and eventually once they were all ready, they attended a [Farm Games Reaping](farm_games_reaping) in Barrie, Ontario. Only Jake was picked to be put in the draft. This stirred a controversy, as the story of Jake and the indian kids became the talk of the town, the new heartwarming story, suddenly dashed by the persistent and expected bigotry of the Farm Games. The Farm Games made an official statement in response to these concerns, saying "we only let Jake Gant in because we are racist". This cleared everything up for the public, and it was deemed the Farm Games had a justification all along.

Gant retired at age 37, scoring 988 points in his career. He was honoured with a day of silence in Newmarket, wherein the town became a complete ghost town and no one left their house or did anything, a tradition that began when [Brown Simpson](brown_simpson) left the team in 1960. The Roadrunners paid tribute to him with a video edit featuring the music of the [Dave Matthews Band](#a), Gant's favourite band. During this same game, pop star [Dushaun Wullucks](#a) played a set during the second intermission. Dushaun appeared on stage amongst smoke and fog and neon lights, and he stood there and everyone was going crazy like with Michael Jackson and then Dushaun bust out into his 1997 comeback hit "I'm Back", that had the crowd absolutely losing their minds. He then followed this up with a soulful and tight rendition of his jazz rock classic "Waterproof Jeans". He then closed out the show with one of the most heartfelt performances of his legendary definitive song, "Rosebush In My Garden", which brought Gant to tears. Dushaun and Gant shared a long hug after the show, and Dushaun left Gant with bizarre piece of leather with a message written in a forgotten script upon it. When Gant read it, he brought the leather to his heart and saluted.

After retiring, Gant had a midlife crisis almost immediately and bought things like a cottage and two boats and two motorcycles because he wanted his wife to ride one too and they would be a motorcycle couple but she didn't want to ride a big stupid loud Harley so he bought her a Mazda instead, and for a while he wore bead and/or sharktooth necklaces, leather jackets and had his hair in a ponytail. He eventually gave this up however when his wife ''really'' stopped having sex with him, so he became a trim and proper [Family Guy](#a), more of a Thanksgiving type guy than a motorcycle dad. He sold his bikes and bought a Honda. 

In 2009, he began working within the Farm Games again in a limited capacity, sometimes appearing on media and TV shows to discuss rumours and what not. Gant got in multiple screaming matches with [Pete Larsgaard](pete_larsgaard) while appearing as the guest on [The Beef Stove](the_beef_stove), which gained him more popularity as a broadcaster. In 2012, Gant tried to make a gritty crime drama film called "Bad City", which featured his blatant self-insert former sports man turned detective character Jack Gordon solving crime and having lots of sex with his hot wife. The project unfortunately never made it very far, as [Denley Studios](#a) nor [Gufflin Studios](#a) were particularly interested in financing it, and Gant had already spent most of his money on his cottage and boats and cars and tripods for his movie. 

After this catastrophe, Gant got into politics in 2014-2015, running on a "nothing held back" platform in his hometown of Sutton. He lost. Following his stint in politics, Gant was running out of money and decided to pursue work in the Farm Games media, becoming the co-host of "[Piss Cold Ice](#a)" with [Stefan Knight](#a) from 2016 until 2019. Since then he has been working as a coaching consultant with [Jonse Cleaver](#a) on the [Houston Giants](#a).

His daughter, [Sabrina Gant](#a), is a lesbian. She has been on the TV, on shows such as [Genuine Leather](#a), [The Hotstove](#a) and [Pennington Rock](#a). His eldest son, [Liam Gant](#a), runs a business grindset Instagram page with 501k followers. His youngest son, [Jesse Lee Gant](#a), currently plays in the pissy leagues on some bumfuck Georgina Rockets team.
