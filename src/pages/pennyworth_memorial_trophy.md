The **Pennyworth Memorial Trophy** is an award in the Farm Games ice hockey league that is awarded to the Best Farm Forward of that given year. It is the most coveted award for Farm Forwards everywhere. 1994 Pennyworth winner [Jimmy Swallow](#a) famously said "I love winning the Pennyworth Memorial Trophy and scoring goals. Let's go Farm Games!" when asked on his feelings regarding the Pennyworth Memorial Trophy. The trophy is named after ancient tier "bookie" type player and Hall of Fame staple [Jon Pennyworth](#a). It is said to be the second coolest looking trophy in the Farm Games, next to the [Denley Cup](denley_cup).

There are rumors that the Pennyworth Memorial Trophy is possessed by a ghost, aka haunted or gloomed. These claims remain unverified by the [Farm Games Paranormal Investigations Unit](#a), although legend has it the trophy is gloomed by Pennyworth's extra dead wife; who was said to have died twice as hard if not three times harder than Jon died, and on the night of the parade no less! She was spited and vengeful, cursing the trophy with her bitchy poltergeist forevermore. Jon was noted as calling her "very rude" in his diaries from the war, claiming he wished to run away with his fellow man at arms Butch Buttfucker, a classic omega move in which two sigma/alpha or otherwise strong, leader men join hands and elope together to do guy stuff rather than deal with the incessant yammering of womyn. This is called MGTOW or Taking The Red Pill.
