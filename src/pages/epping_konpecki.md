**Epping Konpecki** is a former winger in the Farm Games. He played for the [St. John's Mariners](st__john_s_mariners), [New Orleans Braves](#a), [Hamilton Hounds](hamilton_hounds), [Tulsa Tomahawks](#a) and [Kamloops Bohemians](#a) from 1981 to 2003. Epping is the younger brother of [Durney Konpecki](durney_konpecki), cousin to [Bronin Konpecki](#a) and [Rhubergh Konpecki](#a), and uncle of [Dmitri Konpecki](#a). He won the [Denley Cup](denley_cup) in 1996 with the Hamilton Hounds, playing an integral role in their historic playoff run.

Epping entered the league as a hardworking grinder who could score goals close to the net, and racked up 25+ goals in three separate seasons with the St. John's Mariners during the 1980's. His numbers dropped dramatically when he was traded to the New Orleans Braves, who insisted on playing him as a power forward on the first line, where the flaws in his game became evident. He was revitalized in a more shutdown oriented playstyle during his tenure in Hamilton, where he flourished once again, especially come playoff time when he would rack up goals and assists, making his 3rd line deceptively effective offensively.

He was eventually traded to the Tulsa Tomahawks, where he suffered from several injuries and could no longer play the physical game he had become coveted for, leading to a trade to Kamloops. While in Kamloops, Konpecki suffered another injury that he never quite recovered from, hampering his skills even further, ultimately leading to his abandonment by the Bohemians and eventual retirement.

Epping has become an intense anti-vaxxer since the end of his career, a choice that ultimately led to the death of his only son, Buncley Konpecki. Epping was then divorced by his wife and retired to California, where he lives to this day.
