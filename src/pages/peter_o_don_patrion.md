**Peter O'Don Patrion** is a former professional ice hockey forward in the Farm Games ice hockey league. He played for the [Milwaukee Pistons](milwaukee_pistons), [Baltimore Butchers](#a) and [Concord Corsairs](#a) from 1994 to 2011. He won the [Pennyworth Memorial Trophy](pennyworth_memorial_trophy) in 1999, the same year he won a [Denley Cup](denley_cup) with the Milwaukee Pistons. He scored 505 goals and 774 points in his career. O'Don Patrion was entered into the Farm Games Hall of Fame in 2013, two years after his retirement. 

Peter was a well-known cummer in the Farm Games, best recognized for his lewd gestures such as penis jerking and pussy fingering. A perennial jokester, Peter garnered a reputation as a jester type player, making players laugh and doing tricks such as purple nurple. His funny antics got him into trouble, when he made the funny joke about how the [Holocaust](#a) "didn't go down like that" while doing an interview on the daytime television program [Breakfast Television](#a) in 2009. Many called for a public apology from O'Don Patrion, but he claimed he would never apologize because that isn't apart of his principles.

Currently, O'Don Patrion is a frequent guest on [Piss Cold Ice](#a), among other Farm Games programs. He also shills for gambling companies, having a large stake in [Dirty Bets Online](#a), a supposed money laundering scheme conjured up by infamous conman [Coney Liberani](#a) and his goons Peck Pockinson and [Grip Total](#a). He was arrested in summer of 2015 after he was caught drinking and driving with a prostitute in his range rover, $4000 worth of cocaine and crack, sixteen packs of illegally pressed Benedryl, and 14 firearms. He got off thanks to his lawyer, [Spinster Laurent](#a), a well known consort of Coney Liberani.
