The **Brandon Jacks** are a professional ice hockey team in Lord Denley's Glorious Farm Games. They joined the league in 1937 during the [First Farm Games Expansion](first_farm_games_expansion). The Jacks are a proud and classic Farm Games franchise, called the "Pride of Manitoba" by Farm Games experts. There have been statues of Jacks players erected all across Manitoba, and those who besmirch the name of the Brandon Jacks while in Manitoba are often the victim of long and violent "hunts" wherein Jacks haters are kidnapped by Jacksheads and dropped in the remote Manitoban wilderness only to be hunted with crossbows and rifles. Manitoba is also known to be a frequent host of [Farm Games Reapings](farm_games_reaping), as the voter base in Manitoba refuses to vote for any politician who opposes the Reapings, unlike other nanny state provinces such as Ontario or faggy ass Quebec who have attempted to quell the thirst of the Farm Games several times in the past. Manitoba is also known to be the most dense when it comes to the number of Farm Games Compounds, where people are raised in group homes to participate in and engage with the Farm Games, many of these people becoming players, coaches, managers, recruiters and media personnel once being released from the compound.

Manitoba is highly regarded across the Farm Games due to the fact that [Paul Denley](paul_denley) once owned a ranch there, where the [Denley Cup](denley_cup) was forged. This makes Manitobans very proud, claiming that Manitoba is the rightful home of the Denley Cup. In fact, several times over the years, Manitobans have tried to break into the Farm Games Vaults in Halifax in order to steal the Denley Cup and return it to Manitoba, but each time the perpetrators were caught and their hands were struck from their wrists. 

The franchise was founded by John Player's cigarette company, who had recently arrived in Brandon and bought most of the property there making it a [bogie town](#a). The original arena that the Jacks played in was in the center of a corn and bread field, called the [Brandon Super Stadium](#a), but better known colloquially as the Ciggy Butt Barn. In 1984, the Ciggy Butt Barn was nearly destroyed by bomb attacks and arson attempts by the Brandon Retribution Squad, a group of insurgents who wished to cripple the power John Player's cigarettes had in the city. As such, the Jacks needed a new place to play, so local business master, Farm Games fanatic and styrofoam magnate [Styrofoam Jim](#a) donated state of the art arena, the [Styrofoam Dome](#a), to the Jacks organization. 

Despite Manitoba's deep connection to Farm Lore, the Jacks did not win the Denley Cup until 2002, their only championship to this date. The Jacks have been host to many classic and legendary players, such as Hall of Famer's [Flame Crennelchovik](flame_crennelchovik), [Bobby Chenlin](#a), [Roland P. Earle](#a) and [Dominic Desjardins](#a), and hometown legends like [Rhubergh Konpecki](#a), [Hartler Jazz](#a), [Mario Falcone](#a) and [Paul Desjardins](#a). The current team president is long time Farm Games fan and sponsor [Papa John](#a), well known as the creator of Papa John's Pizza.  Roland P. Earle served as the General Manager since 2010, but was removed at the onset of the 2020 campaign and replaced with the Head Coach at the time, [Colin Trevor](#a). Trevor hired funny man and slickster [Rob Filton](#a) as the Head Coach. They are captained by [Danny Hetoya](#a).
