The **Portland Patriots** are an Original Six Team Farm Games ice hockey team. Formed in 1897 by hockey enthusiast and hardcore racist [Hamper Morgansen](#a), the Patriots were the final Original Six team added to the association. They have a deep connection to founding father [Sneeze Chenlin](#a), who vouched for Morgansen and persuaded the Denley Brothers to give Portland the franchise over Victoria. The Patriots are a storied franchise, winning several [Denley Cups](denley_cup) during the [Golden Age](#a) and being oft cited as the team of the 1970's. 

The Patriots have an intense rivalry with fellow Original Six team, the [Calgary Jailbirds](calgary_jailbirds), a rivalry that has been dubbed "The Battle of the Birds" due to both teams sporting birds as their logo. The Patriots organization has referred to the Jailbirds as "filthy monkeys" on several occasions, dubbing them a "savage, disgraceful piece of Farm Games history that should be forgotten". The Patriots are well known for several legendary players, such as the all time most goals record holder [Ted America](#a), generational playmaker [Richard Mansfield](#a), Golden Age star [Bobby Chenlin](#a), classic player [Charlie Fun](#a), and masterful power forward [Flame Crennelchovik](flame_crennelchovik).
