**Gay people** are people who enjoy having sex with each other. The Farm Games has a long history of the gays, dating back to the Golden Age when Bibi Hokonu appeared in the league and created the Miami Foreskin, a team that many have deemed "gay". Some have speculated that the Calgary Jailbirds is a team made up entirely of gay, but this is disputed by the amount of sigma males who dominate the franchise.

Speculation of gay activity within the St. Johns Mariners association have also been confirmed as of March 2nd, 2021, when 3 team members were caught playing grab-ass in the locker room. No comment has been made by the team, but fan outrage is expectedly high.
