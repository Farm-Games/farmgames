**Jocko Fox** is a former right winger in the Farm Games. He is a Hall of Fame inductee, despite having never won a [Denley Cup](denley_cup). Fox was a well known scrapper throughout the league, racking up 213 penalty minutes during his career. While he had a reputation as a tough sigma male, he was also a talented goal scorer, winning the [Pennyworth Memorial Trophy](pennyworth_memorial_trophy) twice as well as the [Duckworth Goblet](#a) in 1995. He captained the [Halifax Walrus](halifax_walrus) from 1997 until his departure from the team in 2004. Fox played alongside other Hall of Fame players such as [Mark Chenlin](#a), [Dean Resler](dean_resler), [Walter MacKenzie](#a) and [Walter Barrett](#a). His rivalry with fellow player [Donal MacDuff](#a) is fondly remembered throughout the league, particularly in St. John's and Calgary as the two played on opposing sides of the heated rivalry and were both considered tough sigma males. He played for the [Calgary Jailbirds](calgary_jailbirds), Halifax Walrus and [Hamilton Hounds](hamilton_hounds) from 1989 until 2007.

He is currently the head coach of the [Albany Rattlers](albany_rattlers).

In 2013, Fox was charged with a DUI and vehicular manslaughter after killing a family of four in Odessa, Texas with his SUV. His legal fee's were paid for by [Roberto Mbembe](#a), and he was brought on as coach for the Albany Rattlers not long after.

Jocko was also the spokesperson for a testosterone supplement in the early 2010's, and continues to plug the supplements during press conferences. Supposedly, players on the Rattlers are made to take the supplements as a way to increase sigma and/or alpha behavior on ice. He is also the Co-chairman of the National Jelqing Committee of Canada.
