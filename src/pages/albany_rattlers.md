The **Albany Rattlers** are an Original Six Teams Ice Hockey team in the Farm Games.

Formed in 1897 by businessman [Lupin Fieldnever](#a), the Albany Rattlers are a staple of the Farm Games association and are considered by many to be "America's Team". The team's mascot, [Rapist the Snake](#a), is known across the world and is one of the most beloved and feared mascots in sports. The team has had many Hall of Fame players, such as [Brown Simpson](brown_simpson), [Abernathy Chenlin](#a), [Ted America](#a), [Richard Kerny](#a), [Harvey Bullock](#a) and [Leonard Marsh](#a), among others.

The Rattlers were an object of controversy in 2020 when it was discovered they were owned by American financier and prolific sex trafficker [Jeffery Epstein](#a), thus prompting an investigation into the organization. The investigation found vast evidence of collusion on part of team president [Roberto Mbembe](#a), and he was arrested before the teams ownership was revoked from the Epstein estate. Ownership of the team is currently up for auction, with the Walt Disney Company and an anonymous private investor looking heavily into purchasing the team.

The team's current president is [Doctor Snake](#a), who served as General Manager until Mbembe's arrest. Snake hired hockey wiz [Trevor Irwin](#a) to take over as General Manager, and retained Hall of Fame player [Jocko Fox](jocko_fox) as Head Coach. [Brick Bronson](#a) is the current captain of the team.
