**Noel Wyndandyk** is a former professional ice hockey winger in the Farm Games. He played for the [Flint Foxcatchers](#a), [Hamilton Hounds](hamilton_hounds), [San Diego Novas](#a), [Regina Dutchman](#a) and [Kansas City Bandits](#a) from 1988 until 2007. Thanks to his small size, Wyndandyk made for a successful speed type player, and he would skate very fast and do tricks around guys to make them look like complete fools. One player, [Stockton Bellrose](stockton_bellrose) of the [Milwaukee Pistons](milwaukee_pistons), said of Wyndandyk in 1998: "[He] made me very dizzy and during the intermission I puked up all my game day stew from [Chef Sneeze](#a), which made me very sad and cost us the game. Noel has done it before and he'll do it again. Some might say I eat too much stew before games, but I will never stop, because the stew is what makes my game so edgy."

Wyndandyk is considered a hero by the Hounds franchise due to his dominant play during the 1995 and 1996 campaigns, ultimately playing a massive role in the organizations first and only [Denley Cup](denley_cup) championship. He scored 32 goals and 50 assists for 82 points in 1997, a career high for Wyndandyk and the highest point total on the team that year. 

Unfortunately, Wyndandyk could never return to that same level of play on other teams. His career hit a second wind during his time on the Regina Dutchman however, as he became a big part of their playoff success in 2004 when he netted 12 points in the second round series against the defending champ [San Francisco Mavericks](#a), scoring the series winning goal in the second overtime period of game seven. The team however fell short in Round 3, losing in six games to the [Calgary Jailbirds](calgary_jailbirds). Wyndandyk's numbers went down over the next two campaigns, culminating in only 1 goal and 1 assist in the 2006 playoffs in Round 1, where the Dutchman were swept by the [Lexington Racers](lexington_racers). He spent one season in Kansas City before retiring.

After his playing career, Wyndandyk did advertising for shoes and a brand of extra thick milk called Strong Milk. In 2012, he was hired as the coach of the Flint Foxcatchers, a position he held until 2014 when he was fired. He returned to Strong Milk until the end of the 2015 campaign, when he was approached by [Houston Giants](#a) team president [Mike Lunchy](#a) about coming on board as a Recruiter. Wyndandyk convinced several stupid high school knuckleheads into auditioning for the Giants, where the team found players like [Tobin Maynard](#a) and [Jimmy McGee](#a). In 2017, Wyndandyk was promoted to General Manager of the Giants after former GM [Buest Standard](#a) retired.
