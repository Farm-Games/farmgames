**World War II**

World War II was when bad men attacked Canada, and America, and France, and they were really mean. But it's true, and they also were mean to Polish people and mean to Spanish people, and the Jews too. Then America did an explosion on Jarpan and, Russia came in and saved Germany. And Russia pushed Germany back from Poland and liberated Germany from the evil Japanese people who were being mean there.
