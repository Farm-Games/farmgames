**Guri Manchelsuk** was a professional ice hockey centreman that played in the lord's glorious Farm Games from 1995 until 2010. He played for the [Halifax Walrus](halifax_walrus), [Newmarket Roadrunners](newmarket_roadrunners) and [San Francisco Mavericks](#a). He is fondly remembered for his time serving as captain of the Roadrunners during the early 2000's, and is often cited as one of the greatest Roadrunners of all time, alongside hometown legends such as [Brown Simpson](brown_simpson), [Durg Kennelby](#a), [Jake Gant](jake_gant), [Daniel Rissous](#a) and [Davey Antednusky](#a).

Manchelsuk was known for his physical play, both in the locker room and on the ice. His in-your-face playstyle has been likened to the [Wakkit-Socket Theorum](#a), though some claim it is less sophisticated and that Manchelsuk instead verges on being a trickster or bastard type player. Regardless of his controversial hands-on nothing held back sigma presence, Manchelsuk was among the top goal scorers on the team, racking up 44 goals in 2003 for his career record. Over his 15 year career, Manchelsuk scored 732 points. He was nominated for the [Pennyworth Memorial Trophy](pennyworth_memorial_trophy) twice, in 2003 and 2005. He lost both years, to [Zake Coriander](#a) and [Reefer Chenlin](#a) respectively.

After retirement, Guri started advertising esoteric European products, and later became involved in a high profile pyramid scheme called "Luxwave". In 2015, Manchelsuk was sued as a part of a lawsuit against Luxwave, although he was let off with a lighter fine than the founders and other associates of the scam. After the lawsuit, Manchelsuk mostly disappeared from the public eye, until July 2019 when he was spotted wandering around the streets of Barrie, Ontario in some sort of fugue state. He has since escaped his fugue state, and has returned to Europe where he has been supposedly attending a sabbatical. He currently pushes alternative medicine and cosmic psychology/philosophy on social media, and plans to return to the Farm Games through a position in the media in the near future, though the Farm Games and their media affiliates have declined to comment on this possibility.
