**James Joseph Michael "Unchained" Thompson**  is a professional settler colonial Canadian ice hockey centreman in the Farm Games. He comes from the diseased town of Meaford, Ontario, which is said to be the most Farm Games lethal zone in all of the Great Lakes region. Jamie is a sigma/gamma player and is a talented power forward, being described by Farm Games experts as a "doofus" type player, making faces and what not. Somewhat of a goofball, James Joseph Michael is known for wearing wool and big socks. He has gone on record saying he wishes he was a Japanese person and intends to use his Farm Games money to get Asian Facialization surgery to make himself appear as a real Japonese Man.

Jamie is known to be lawnpilled and also hates [cancel culture](#a), sticking true to his roots as a "man's man" portraying sigma values.<blockquote>"B- llocks to the snowflake generation!!" - Jamie Thompson, 2021</blockquote>He was drafted in 2018 by the [Portland Patriots](portland_patriots), where he played one season before joining the [St. John's Mariners](st__john_s_mariners), playing alongside his older brother and sigma mentor [Sean Thompson](sean_thompson). James is well known friends with fellow Farm Games players like [Talyn Birch](#a), [Matthew Hawken](matthew_hawken) (whom he generously refers to as "the smartest man in the world" or "Big Man"), [Sterling Mackenzie](#a), [Dalton Welsh](dalton_welsh), [Kev Burgess](kev_burgess), [Jon Loeppky](#a) and many more. He is said to have the most friends in the Farm Games, making him a "friendly" sigma. He has gone on record stating he despises [Tristen Killeen](tristen_killeen), of the [Hamilton Hounds](hamilton_hounds), due to him being his old boyfriend. James is a member of [the gays](the_gays) and is considered the coolest and "most dripped" fag/queercoded player in the league.

In 2021, James officially endorsed his General Manager [Rick Daines](#a) when he ran as a member of the PPC, saying:<blockquote>"Purple Wave Incoming!! There are only two options; PPC or Communism! Enough cancel culture!! Purple Wave Purple Wave!!" - Jamie Thompson, 2021</blockquote><blockquote><br /></blockquote>
