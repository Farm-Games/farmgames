**Durney Konpecki** is a Polish-Canadian professional ice hockey winger in the Farm Games ice hockey league. Drafted in 1979 by the [Cleveland Red Roosters](cleveland_red_roosters), Durney is one of few Farm Games players to have won with every team he played with, winning three cups with the Red Roosters between 1983-85, one with the [Albany Rattlers](albany_rattlers) in 1989, and one with the [Milwaukee Pistons](milwaukee_pistons) in 1999. As such, Durney is considered one of the greatest Farm Games players of all time, racking up 701 points in his 21 year long career. Durney is the 2nd cousin of [Bronin Konpecki](#a), the older brother of [Epping Konpecki](epping_konpecki), father to [Dmitri Konpecki](#a) and grandfather of [Lemony Konpecki](#a). [Cank Dzvtednuska](#a) is his 1st cousin once removed on his mother's side.

Durney's parents, Lube Konpecki and Mistreselle Dzvtednuska, immigrated to Canada from Poland in 1959, a year before Durney was born, alongside Mistreselle's uncle, Stub Dzvtednuska and his two wives. They settled in Moncton, New Brunswick, where they lived for several years. Durney used to play field hockey with a bunch of lesbians, who took him in as one of their own. As such, Durney considers himself a half lesbian, and a devout TERF. He was found at a [Farm Games Reaping](farm_games_reaping) somewhere in Quebec, and was put in the Farm Games draft for 1978 but was left unselected until 1979. Durney played a tough lesbian playstyle, playing strong and hard and ruffling men in the corners. Durney was often labeled a bastard type player due to his remarks on ice and for spitting on other players. He had a career year with the Albany Rattlers in 1988, scoring 43 goals and 60 assists for 103 points.

Durney retired in 2000, and promptly left his wife in order to return to Poland to be with a Japanese woman he claimed to be in love with. This turned out to be a ruse, and Konpecki was robbed. He remained in Poland for the next several years, marrying a miserable woman named Helmut. He eventually returned to Canada, leaving Helmut behind and declining to comment on her fate. He spent most of the 2000's advertising for an all-lesbian anti-abortion group, but parted with the organization in 2009 after a drunken brawl at a Pizza Pizza in Owen Sound. Durney then became a violent alcoholic, being known openly as such due to several public disturbances. In 2013, he started a fundraiser for children in the Congo alongside supposed "veteran of the Congo War" Brooks Painfield and entrepeneur [Johnny McChicken-Dougal](#a), but the trio pocketed the funds and were targets of a large investigation. Painfield was found to be stealing valour and was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was drone striked after 6. McChicken-Dougal fled the country, supposedly he has been living in Polynesia ever since. Konpecki was in hot water but was saved by the Farm Games Network, who offered him a job as a sports analyst. Konpecki appeared as a guest on many shows such as [The Beef Stove](the_beef_stove), [Sex Box](#a), [Let's Talk!: Farm Games](#a), and [Denley Roundtable](#a), as well as hosting the [Farm Awards Ceremony](#a) in 2016 and 2018.
