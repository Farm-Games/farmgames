**Brown Simpson** is a legendary right winger and Farm Games Hall of Fame inductee. He is widely regarded as the greatest Farm Games player of all time. Simpson held the all time points record in the league until 1999, when he was surpassed by [Dominic Desjardins](#a). His career spanned over 20 years, from 1944 until 1967, making him one of the longest playing Farm Games forwards of all time. 

Brown was born in New Orleans in 1926. His first word was "hockey". 

He was a staple of the [Golden Age](#a) of the Farm Games, and was largely responsible for leading the [Newmarket Roadrunners](newmarket_roadrunners) to five separate [Denley Cup](denley_cup) victories between 1947 and 1958. Simpson played for the Newmarket Roadrunners and the [Albany Rattlers](albany_rattlers) during his time in the league, becoming captain of both teams during his tenure there. He sported #40 through his entire career, and the number has become synonymous with his name throughout the Farm Games.

Brown is also known to be the first player to engage in the [Denley Fast](#a), a tradition in which a player fasts for the entirety of the playoffs, until they are either eliminated or win the Denley. If they win, they feast for the first time in weeks upon the [Denley Stew](#a), which revitalizes them and fills them with pride and gas. Several other players have engaged in the Denley Fast since the days of Brown, and it is seen as a showing of complete commitment to the Farm Games and to the Denley.
