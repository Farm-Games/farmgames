The **Halifax Walrus** are an Original Six Teams Farm Games ice hockey team. Widely regarded as one of the most legendary franchises in the Farm Games, the team was inducted into the league in 1897, founded by seaman [Rufus Booder](#a). The Walrus have won several [Denley Cups](denley_cup) throughout the years, but have also suffered long droughts in between cups ever since the end of the [Golden Age](#a).

The Walrus were purchased from the Booder family by seafood chain [Red Lobster](#a) in 2008, and a man only known as [Red Lobster Tim](#a) currently sits as the team president. [Grant Bundy](#a) acts as General Manager, with Hall of Fame player [Donal MacDuff](#a) as head coach. [Leo Chinaski](#a) is the current captain of the team.

Halifax are staunch rivals of the [St. John's Mariners](st__john_s_mariners), their east coast enemies, who have consistently shown them up in modern Farm Games history. They also have a harsh rivalry with the [Albany Rattlers](albany_rattlers), an animosity that was fostered during the Golden Age when the teams met several times in the Denley Tournament. Other rivals include the [Calgary Jailbirds](calgary_jailbirds), a rivalry that recently hit fever pitch after their meeting in the Denley Cup Finals last year, where the Walrus dethroned the defending champion Jailbirds, and the [Cleveland Red Roosters](cleveland_red_roosters), a rivalry based on the fact the Walrus sport blue and white while the Roosters sport red and white.
