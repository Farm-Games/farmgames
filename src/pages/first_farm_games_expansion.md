The **First Farm Games Expansion** was an expansion of the Farm Games from six teams to fourteen. The expansion took place in 1937, when several businessmen and wealthy plutocrats banded together to take advantage of the working class during the Great Depression by offering low end salaries to play on their Farm Games ice hockey teams. The Farm Games expansion teams also provided great places for draft dodgers once the war started.
